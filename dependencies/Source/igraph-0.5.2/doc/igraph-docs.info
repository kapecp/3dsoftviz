1 Introduction
**************

This is another library for creating and manipulating graphs.  You can
look at it two ways: first, igraph contains the implementation of quite
a lot graph algorithms. These include classic graph algorithms like
graph isomorphism, graph girth and connectivity and also the new wave
graph algorithms like transitivity, graph motifs and community
structure detection. Skim through the table of contents or the index of
this book to get an impression.

   Second, igraph provides a platform for the developing and/or
implementing graph algorithms. It has a quite efficient data structure
for representing graphs and a number of other data structures like
flexible vectors, stacks, heaps, queues, adjacency lists to accomplish
this. In fact these data structures evolved along the implementation of
the classic and non-classic graph algorithms which make up the major
part of the igraph library. This way they were fine tuned and checked
for correctness several times.

   Our main goal with developing igraph was to create a graph library
which is efficient on large but not extremely large graphs. More
precisely, it is assumed that the graph(s) fit into the physical memory
of the computer. Nowadays this means graphs with several million
vertices and/or edges. Our definition of efficient is that it runs
fast, both in theory and (more importantly) in practice.

   We believe that one of the big strengths of igraph is that it can be
embedded into a higher level language or environment. Two such
embeddings (or interfaces if you look at them the other way) are
currently being developed by us: igraph as a GNU R package and igraph
as a Python extension module. A third embedding, being developed by
another developer is a Ruby extension. Other are likely to come. The
high level languages as R or Python make it possible to do use graph
routines with mush greater comfort, without actually writing a single
line of C code. They have some, usually very small, speed penalty
compared to the C version, but add ease and much flexibility. This
manual however covers only the C library. If you want to use Python or
GNU R, please see the documentation written specifically for these
interfaces and come back here only if you're interested in some detail
which is not covered in those documents.

   We still consider igraph as a child project. It has much room for
development and we are sure that it will improve a lot in the near
future. Any feedback we can get from the users is very important for
us, as most of the time these questions and comments guide us in what
to add and what to improve.

   igraph is open source and distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL.
We strongly believe that all the algorithms used in science, let that
be graph theory or not, should have an efficient open source
implementation allowing use and modification for anyone.

2 Installation
**************

First download the latest version of `igraph' from `igraph' homepage
(http://cneurocvs.rmki.kfki.hu/igraph) or from SourceForge
(http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=160289), and
uncompress it to a temporary directory:


     $ wget http://cneurocvs.rmki.kfki.hu/igraph/download/igraph-0.2.tar.gz
     $ tar xzf igraph-0.2.tar.gz
     $ cd igraph-0.2

   To install the complete C library typing


     $ ./configure
     $ make
     $ make install

(the latter as root) should work on most systems. You can try


     $ ./configure --help

to see installations options, and reading the `INSTALL' file.

   Installing the `igraph' R package is very simple, you don't need to
download anything by hand, just give the command


     > install.packages("igraph", lib="~/.R/library")

in R and select a mirror site close to you. The `lib' argument
specifies the directory to which the package will be installed. If not
specified, this will be default system wide R package directory. You
must have write permissions for this directory.

   Also, consult your R documentation.

   Installing the `igraph' Python package is a little bit more
difficult, since chances are that you have to compile it for yourself
(as long as there is no compile farm at the Python Package Index and we
can't compile it ourselves to all platforms). First, check if there is
a compiled version available for your system at igraph's Python Package
Index page (http://www.python.org/pypi/igraph). If there is, just use
that. (Python eggs should be put anywhere in your Python library path,
executable installers should be executed of course). If there isn't,
you'll have to compile it by hand. So, first install a recent C
compiler.

   We usually compile `igraph' with the GNU C compiler
(http://gcc.gnu.org). If you are a Windows user, you can find it as
part of the Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com) environment or in the
MinGW+MSYS (http://www.mingw.org) project. You can also try Microsoft's
free C compiler suite (or even worse, Visual Studio), but there are
known issues with the compilation of `igraph' in MSVC, and you'll have
to resolve them yourself by tweaking the source code. (Patches are
welcome! :)). If you use Linux, `gcc' is usually included in your
default system, but even if it isn't, there will be a package from
which you can install it. (In Debian and Ubuntu Linux, you'll have to
install the package called `build-essential').  If you have a Mac,
`gcc' is part of the Xcode developer suite, which is usually included
in your OS X install DVD, or can be obtained freely from the Apple
Developer Connection (http://developer.apple.com/tools/downloads/)
website.

   After having obtained a C compiler, you'll have to install an XML
processing library called `libxml2'. Windows users should get it from
this website (http://xmlsoft.org) (there are binary versions, no need
to compile anything), Linux users should be able to find a package
again in their respective distribution (Debian and Ubuntu users:
install the `libxml2' and `libxml2-dev' libraries).  Mac users should
not do anything, since `libxml2' is part of the default system
installation. However, you should check it anyway, launch a terminal
and type the following command:


     $ xml2-config

If you don't receive any error message, you can go on to the next step.

   Now, get the `igraph' source from the Python Package Index
(http://www.python.org/pypi/igraph), extract it to a directory and
start the compilation. On Windows, launch the Cygwin or MinGW
environment and type:


     $ python setup.py build --compiler=cygwin

(Instead of `--compiler=cygwin', `--compiler=mingw32' should also work,
then you have no POSIX emulation available (you don't really need it for
`igraph' yet), but you also won't need `cygwin1.dll'). If the shell
keeps on complaining that it does not find the Python interpreter, use
its full path. For instance, if you have Python installed in
`C:\Devel\Python24', use the following command:


     $ /cygdrive/c/devel/python24/python setup.py build --compiler=cygwin

If the compilation finished without errors, you can install the library:


     $ python setup.py install

(Use the full path again if necessary).

   Linux and Mac users should succeed with the following commands
issued from the `igraph' root directory:


     $ python setup.py build
     $ python setup.py install

Note that you'll need write permissions to the Python library path, so
usually you must have root permissions to issue the second command. If
you want to install it to a different directory, just copy everything
from the `build/lib.*' subdirectory to wherever you want.

3.1 Lesson 1. Compiling programs using igraph.
==============================================

The following short example program demonstrates the basic usage of the
`igraph' library.


     #include <igraph.h>

     int main(void)
     {
          igraph_real_t diameter;
          igraph_t graph;
          igraph_erdos_renyi_game(&graph, IGRAPH_ERDOS_RENYI_GNP, 1000, 5.0/1000,
                                  IGRAPH_UNDIRECTED, IGRAPH_NO_LOOPS);
          igraph_diameter(&graph, &diameter, 0, 0, 0, IGRAPH_UNDIRECTED, 1);
          printf("Diameter of a random graph with average degree 5: %f\n",
                  (double) diameter);
          igraph_destroy(&graph);
          return 0;
     }

   This example illustrates a couple of points. First, programs using
the `igraph' library should include the `igraph.h' header file. Second,
`igraph' uses the `igraph_real_t' type for real numbers instead of
`double'. Third, `igraph' graph objects are represented by the
`igraph_t' data type. Fourth, the `igraph_erdos_renyi_game()' (*note
igraph_erdos_renyi_game --- Generates a random [Erdos-Renyi] graph_::)
creates a graph and `igraph_destroy()' (*note igraph_destroy --- Frees
the memory allocated for a graph object_::) destroys it, ie.
deallocates the memory associated to it.

   For compiling this program you need a C compiler, if this is called
`gcc' and the previous code is saved in file `igraph_test.c', you will
need a command like this:


     gcc igraph_test.c -I/usr/local/igraph -L/usr/local/lib -ligraph -o igraph_test

   The exact form depends on where `igraph' was installed on your
system. The directory after the `-I' switch is the one containing the
`igraph.h' file, while the one following `-L' should contain the
library file itself, usually a file called `libigraph.so',
`libigraph.a' or `igraph.dll'.  It your system has the `pkg-config'
utility you are likely to get the neccessary compile options by issuing
the command


     pkg-config --libs --cflags igraph

   The executable can be run by simply typing its name like this:


     ./igraph_test

on most systems. If you use dynamic linking and the `igraph' libraries
are not at a standard place, you may need to set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH'
variable, the syntax depends on the shell use are using. In `bash' it
goes like this:


     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/user/libs/igraph
     ./igraph_test

Here we assumed that the `igraph' library is installed in
`/home/user/libs/igraph'. Alternatively, you can use the `LD_PRELOAD'
variable to preload the `igraph' library before invoking your program:


     LD_PRELOAD=/home/user/libs/igraph/libigraph.so ./igraph_test

Please note that `LD_PRELOAD' and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' are usually
available only on Un*x-like systems. On Windows using Cygwin it is
usually enough to set the `PATH' enviroment variable to include the
folder in which the `igraph' library is installed, look for the
`cygigraph-0.dll' or similar file.

3.2 Lesson 2. Creating your first graphs.
=========================================

The functions generating graph objects are called graph generators.
Stochastic (=randomized) graph generators are called `games'.

   `igraph' can handle directed and undirected graphs. Most graph
generators are able to create both types of graphs and most other
functions are usually also capable of handling both. Eg.
`igraph_shortest_paths()' (*note igraph_shortest_paths --- The length
of the shortest paths between vertices_::) which (surprisingly)
calculates shortest paths from a vertex to another vertices can
calculate directed or undirected paths.

   `igraph' has sophisticated ways for creating graphs. The simplest
graphs are deterministic regular structures like star graphs
(`igraph_star()' (*note igraph_star --- Creates a star graph; every
vertex connects only to the center_::)), ring graphs (`igraph_ring()'
(*note igraph_ring --- Creates a ring graph; a one dimensional
lattice_::)), lattices (`igraph_lattice()' (*note igraph_lattice ---
Creates most kind of lattices_::)) or trees (`igraph_tree()' (*note
igraph_tree --- Creates a tree in which almost all vertices have the
same number of children_::)).

   The following example creates an undirected regular circular lattice,
adds some random edges to it and calculates the average length of
shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in the graph before and
after adding the random edges. (The message is that some random edges
can reduce path lengths a lot.)


     #include <igraph.h>

     int main(void) {
       igraph_real_t avg_path;
       igraph_t graph;
       igraph_vector_t dimvector;
       igraph_vector_t edges;
       int i;

       igraph_vector_init(&dimvector, 2);
       VECTOR(dimvector)[0]=30;
       VECTOR(dimvector)[1]=30;
       igraph_lattice(&graph, &dimvector, 0, IGRAPH_UNDIRECTED, 0, 1);

       srand(100);
       igraph_vector_init(&edges, 20);
       for (i=0; i<igraph_vector_size(&edges); i++) {
         VECTOR(edges)[i] = rand() % (int)igraph_vcount(&graph);
       }

       igraph_average_path_length(&graph, &avg_path, IGRAPH_UNDIRECTED, 1);
       printf("Average path length (lattice):            %f\n", (double) avg_path);

       igraph_add_edges(&graph, &edges, 0);
       igraph_average_path_length(&graph, &avg_path, IGRAPH_UNDIRECTED, 1);
       printf("Average path length (randomized lattice): %f\n", (double) avg_path);

       igraph_vector_destroy(&dimvector);
       igraph_vector_destroy(&edges);
       igraph_destroy(&graph);

       return 0;
     }

   This example illustrates some new points. `igraph' uses
`igraph_vector_t' (*note About igraph_vector_t objects::) instead of
plain C arrays. `igraph_vector_t' is superior to regular arrays in
almost every sense. Vectors are created by the `igraph_vector_init()'
(*note igraph_vector_init --- Initializes a vector object
[constructor]_::) function and like graphs they should be destroyed if
not needed any more by calling `igraph_vector_destroy()' (*note
igraph_vector_destroy --- Destroys a vector object_::) on them. A
vector can be indexed by the `VECTOR()' (*note VECTOR --- Accessing an
element of a vector_::) function (right now it is a macro). Vectors can
be resized, eg. most `igraph' functions returning the result in a
vector resize it to the size of the result.

   `igraph_lattice()' (*note igraph_lattice --- Creates most kind of
lattices_::) takes a vector argument specifying the dimensions of the
lattice, in this example we generate a 30x30 two dimensional lattice.
See the documentation of `igraph_lattice()' (*note igraph_lattice ---
Creates most kind of lattices_::) in the reference manual for the other
arguments.

   The vertices in a graph are identified by an integer number between
0 and N-1, N is the number of vertices in the graph (this can be
obtained by `igraph_vcount()' (*note igraph_vcount --- The number of
vertices in a graph::), as in the example).

   The `igraph_add_edges()' (*note igraph_add_edges --- Adds edges to a
graph object_::) function simply takes a graph and a vector of vertex
ids defining the new edges. The first edge is between the first two
vertex ids in the vector, the second edge is between the second two,
etc. This way we add ten random edges to the lattice.

   Note that in the example it is possible to add loop edges, edges
pointing to the same vertex and multiple edges, more than one edge
between the same pair of vertices.  `igraph_t' can of course represent
loops and multiple edges, although some routines expect simple graphs,
ie. graphs without loop and multiple edges, because for example some
structural properties are ill-defined for non-simple graphs. Loop edges
can be removed by calling `igraph_simplify()' (*note igraph_simplify
--- Removes loop and/or multiple edges from the graph_::).

3.3 Lesson 3. Calculating various properties of graphs.
=======================================================

In our next example we will calculate various centrality measures in a
friendship graph. The friendship graph is from the famous Zachary karate
club study. (Web search on 'Zachary karate' if you want to know more
about this.) Centrality measures quantify how central is the position of
individual vertices in the graph.

          return 0;
     }

   This example reflects some new features. First of all, it shows a
way to define a graph simply as defining a C array with its edges.
Function `igraph_vector_view()' (*note igraph_vector_view --- Handle a
regular C array as a igraph_vector_t_::) creates a _view_ of a C array.
It does not copy any data, this also means that you should not call
`igraph_vector_destroy()' (*note igraph_vector_destroy --- Destroys a
vector object_::) on a vector created this way. This vector is then
used to create the undirected graph.

   Then the degree, closeness and betweenness centrality of the vertices
is calculated and the highest values are printed. Note that the vector
(`result') which returns the result from these functions has to be
initialized first, and also that the functions resize it to be able to
hold the result.

   The `igraph_vss_all()' argument tells the functions to calculate the
property for every vertex in the graph, it is shorthand for a _vertex
selector_ (`igraph_vs_t').  Vertex selectors help performing operations
on a subset of vertices, you can read more about them in one of the
following chapters. (*note Vertex and Edge Selectors and Sequences;

4.1 The igraph data model
=========================

The igraph library can handle directed and undirected graphs. The
igraph graphs are multisets of ordered (if directed) or unordered (if
undirected) labeled pairs.  The labels of the pairs plus the number of
vertices always starts with zero and ends with the number of edges
minus one. In addition to that a table of metadata is also attached to
every graph, its most important entries are the number of vertices in
the graph and whether the graph is directed or undirected.

   Like the edges, the igraph vertices are also labeled by number
between zero and the number of vertices minus one.  So, to summarize, a
directed graph can be imagined like this:


       ( vertices: 6,
         directed: yes,
         {
          (0,2),
          (2,2),
          (2,3),
          (3,3),
          (3,4),
          (3,4),
          (4,1)
         }
       )

Here the edges are ordered pairs or vertex ids, and the graph is a
multiset of edges plus some meta-data.

   An undirected graph is like this:


       ( vertices: 6,
         directed: no,
         {
          {0,2},
          {2},
          {2,3},
          {3},
          {3,4},
          {3,4},
          {4,1}
         }
       )

Here an edge is a set of one or two vertex ids, two for most of the
time, except for loop edges. A graph is a multiset of edges plus meta
data, just like in the directed case.

   It is possible to convert a directed graph to an undirected one, see
the `igraph_to_directed()' (*note igraph_to_directed --- Convert an
undirected graph to a directed one::) and `igraph_to_undirected()'
(*note igraph_to_undirected --- Convert a directed graph to an
undirected one_::) functions.

   Note that igraph has some limited support for graphs with multiple
edges. The support means that multiple edges can be stored in igraph
graphs, but for most functions (like `igraph_betweenness()' (*note
igraph_betweenness --- Betweenness centrality of some vertices_::)) it
is not checked that they work well on graphs with multiple edges.  To
eliminate multiple edges from a graph, you can use `igraph_simplify()'
(*note igraph_simplify --- Removes loop and/or multiple edges from the
graph_::).

4.2 The basic interface
=======================

This is the very minimal API in `igraph'. All the other functions use
this minimal set for creating and manipulating the graphs.

   This is a very important principle since it makes possible to
implement other data representations by implementing only this minimal
set.

   Use this instead of `igraph_empty()' (*note igraph_empty --- Creates
an empty graph with some vertices and no edges_::) if you wish to add
some graph attributes right after initialization. This function is
currently not very interesting for the ordinary user, just supply 0
here or use `igraph_empty()' (*note igraph_empty --- Creates an empty

`igraph_destroy()' (*note igraph_destroy --- Frees the memory allocated
for a graph object_::) on it when not needed any more.

   You can also create a shallow copy of a graph by simply using the
standard assignment operator, but be careful and do _not_ destroy a
shallow replica. To avoid this mistake creating shallow copies is not
recommended.

   This function changes the ids of the vertices (except in some very
special cases, but these should not be relied on anyway).

   This function invalidates all iterators.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     The graph to work on.

`vertices':
     The ids of the vertices to remove in a vector. The vector may
     contain the same id more than once.

   *Returns:. *

`'
     Error code: `IGRAPH_EINVVID': invalid vertex id.

   Time complexity: O(|V|+|E|), |V| and |E| are the number of vertices
and edges in the original graph.

5.1 Error handling basics
=========================

`igraph' functions can run into various problems preventing them from
normal operation: the user might have supplied invalid arguments, eg. a
non-square matrix when a square-matrix was expected, or the program has
run out of memory while some more memory allocation is required, etc.

   By default `igraph' aborts the program when it runs into an error.
While this behavior might be good enough for smaller programs, it is
without doubt avoidable in larger projects. Please read further if your
project requires more sophisticated error handling. You can safely skip
the rest of this chapter otherwise.


File: igraph_reference_manual.info,  Node: Error handlers,  Next: Error codes,  Prev: Error handling basics,  Up: Error Handling

5.2 Error handlers
==================

If `igraph' runs into an error - an invalid argument was supplied to a
function, or we've ran out of memory - the control is transferred to
the _ error handler _ function.

   The default error handler is `igraph_error_handler_abort' (*note
igraph_error_handler_abort --- Abort program in case of error_::) which
prints an error message and aborts the program.

   The `igraph_set_error_handler()' (*note igraph_set_error_handler ---
Set a new error handler_::) function can be used to set a new error
handler function of type `igraph_error_handler_t' (*note
igraph_error_handler_t --- Type of error handler functions_::), see the
documentation of this type for details.

   There are two other predefined error handler functions,
`igraph_error_handler_ignore' (*note igraph_error_handler_ignore ---
Ignore errors_::) and `igraph_error_handler_printignore' (*note
igraph_error_handler_printignore --- Print and ignore errors_::), these
deallocate the temporarily allocated memory (more about this later) and
return with the error code. The latter also prints an error message. If
you use these error handlers you need to take care about possible
errors yourself by checking the return value of (almost) every non-void
`igraph' function.

   Independently of the error handler installed, all functions in the
library do their best to leave their arguments _semantically_ unchanged
if an error happens. By semantically we mean that the implementation of
an object supplied as an argument might change, but its `meaning' in
most cases does not. The rare occasions when this rule is violated are
documented in this manual.

5.3 Error codes
===============

Every `igraph' function which can fail return a single integer error
code. Some functions are very simple and cannot run into any error,
these may return other types, or `void' as well. The error codes are
defined by the `igraph_error_type_t' (*note igraph_error_type_t ---
Error code type_::) enumeration.

   These are the possible valued returned by `igraph' functions.  Note
that these are interesting only if you defined an error handler with

5.4.1 Writing error handlers
----------------------------

The contents of the rest of this chapter might be useful only for those
who want to create an interface to `igraph' from another language. Most
readers can safely skip to the next chapter.

   You can write and install error handlers simply by defining a
function of type `igraph_error_handler_t' (*note igraph_error_handler_t
--- Type of error handler functions_::) and calling
`igraph_set_error_handler()' (*note igraph_set_error_handler --- Set a
new error handler_::). This feature is useful for interface writers, as
`igraph' will have the chance to signal errors the appropriate way, eg.
the R interface defines an error handler which calls the `error()'
function, as required by R, while the Python interface has an error
handler which raises an exception according to the Python way.

   If you want to write an error handler, your error handler should
call `IGRAPH_FINALLY_FREE()' (*note IGRAPH_FINALLY_FREE --- Deallocate
all registered objects_::) to deallocate all temporary memory to
prevent memory leaks.

* igraph_set_error_handler --- Set a new error handler.: igraph_set_error_handler --- Set a new error handler_.

............................................................


     igraph_error_handler_t*
     igraph_set_error_handler(igraph_error_handler_t* new_handler);

   Installs a new error handler. If called with 0, it installs the
default error handler (which is currently `igraph_error_handler_abort'
(*note igraph_error_handler_abort --- Abort program in case of
error_::)).

   *Arguments:. *

`new_handler':
     The error handler function to install.

   *Returns:. *

`'
     The old error handler function. This should be saved and restored
     if `new_handler' is not needed any more.

5.4.2 Error handling internals
------------------------------

If an error happens, the functions in the library call the
`IGRAPH_ERROR' (*note IGRAPH_ERROR --- Trigger an error_::) macro with
a textual description of the error and an `igraph' error code. This
macro calls (through the `igraph_error()' (*note igraph_error ---
Trigger an error_::) function) the installed error handler. Another
useful macro is `IGRAPH_CHECK()' (*note IGRAPH_CHECK --- Check the
return value of a function call_::), this checks the return value of its
argument which is normally a function call, and calls `IGRAPH_ERROR'
(*note IGRAPH_ERROR --- Trigger an error_::) if it is not
`IGRAPH_SUCCESS'.

5.4.2.1 IGRAPH_ERROR -- Trigger an error.
.........................................


     #define IGRAPH_ERROR(reason,igraph_errno)

   `igraph' functions usually use this macro when they notice an error.
It calls `igraph_error()' (*note igraph_error --- Trigger an error_::)
with the proper parameters and if that returns the macro returns the
"calling" function as well, with the error code. If for some
(suspicious) reason you want to call the error handler without
returning from the current function, call `igraph_error()' (*note
igraph_error --- Trigger an error_::) directly.

   *Arguments:. *

`reason':
     Textual description of the error. This should be something more
     explaning than the text associated with the error code. Eg. if the
     error code is `IGRAPH_EINVAL', its asssociated text (see
     `igraph_strerror()' (*note igraph_strerror --- Textual description
     of an error_::)) is "Invalid value" and this string should explain
     which parameter was invalid and maybe why.

`igraph_errno':
     The `igraph' error code.

5.4.2.2 igraph_error -- Trigger an error.
.........................................


     int igraph_error(const char *reason, const char *file, int line,
     		 int igraph_errno);

   `igraph' functions usually call this fuction (most often via the
`IGRAPH_ERROR' (*note IGRAPH_ERROR --- Trigger an error_::) macro) if
they notice an error.  It calls the currently installed error handler
function with the supplied arguments.

   *Arguments:. *

`reason':
     Textual description of the error.

`file':
     The source file in which the error was noticed.

`line':
     The number of line in the source file which triggered the error.

`igraph_errno':
     The `igraph' error code.

   *Returns:. *

`'
     the error code (if it returns)

5.4.2.3 IGRAPH_CHECK -- Check the return value of a function call.
..................................................................


     #define IGRAPH_CHECK(a)

   *Arguments:. *

`a':
     An expression, usually a function call.

   Executes the expression and checks its value. If this is not
`IGRAPH_SUCCESS', it calls `IGRAPH_ERROR' (*note IGRAPH_ERROR ---
Trigger an error_::) with the value as the error code. Here is an
example usage:

      IGRAPH_CHECK(vector_push_back(&v, 100));

   There is only one reason to use this macro when writing `igraph'
functions. If the user installs an error handler which returns to the
auxilary calling code (like `igraph_error_handler_ignore' (*note
igraph_error_handler_ignore --- Ignore errors_::) and
`igraph_error_handler_printignore' (*note
igraph_error_handler_printignore --- Print and ignore errors_::)), and
the `igraph' function signalling the error is called from another
`igraph' function then we need to make sure that the error is
propagated back to the auxilary (ie. non-igraph) calling function. This
is achieved by using `IGRAPH_CHECK' on every `igraph' call which can
return an error code.


File: igraph_reference_manual.info,  Node: Deallocating memory,  Next: Writing igraph functions with proper error handling,  Prev: Error handling internals,  Up: Advanced topics

5.4.3 Deallocating memory
-------------------------

If a function runs into an error (and the program is not aborted) the
error handler should deallocate all temporary memory. This is done by
storing the address and the destroy function of all temporary objects
in a stack. The `IGRAPH_FINALLY' (*note IGRAPH_FINALLY --- Register an
object for deallocation_::) function declares an object as temporary by
placing its address in the stack. If an `igraph' function returns with
success it calls `IGRAPH_FINALLY_CLEAN()' (*note IGRAPH_FINALLY_CLEAN
--- Signal clean deallocation of objects_::) with the number of objects
to remove from the stack. If an error happens however, the error
handler should call `IGRAPH_FINALLY_FREE()' (*note IGRAPH_FINALLY_FREE
--- Deallocate all registered objects_::) to deallocate each object
added to the stack. This means that the temporary objects allocated in
the calling function (and etc.) will be freed as well.

5.4.3.1 IGRAPH_FINALLY -- Register an object for deallocation.

     #define IGRAPH_FINALLY(func,ptr)

   *Arguments:. *

`func':
     The address of the function which is normally called to destroy
     the object.

`ptr':
     Pointer to the object itself.

   This macro places the address of an object, together with the
address of its destructor in a stack. This stack is used if an error
happens to deallocate temporarily allocated objects to prevent memory
leaks.

5.4.3.2 IGRAPH_FINALLY_CLEAN -- Signal clean deallocation of objects.
.....................................................................


     void IGRAPH_FINALLY_CLEAN(int num);

   Removes the specified number of objects from the stack of

returning from a function.

   *Arguments:. *

`num':
     The number of objects to remove from the bookkeeping stack.

5.4.3.3 IGRAPH_FINALLY_FREE -- Deallocate all registered objects.
.................................................................


     void IGRAPH_FINALLY_FREE(void);

   Calls the destroy function for all objects in the stack of
temporarily allocated objects. This is usually called only from an
error handler. It is _not_ appropriate to use it instead of destroying
each unneeded object of a function, as it destroys the temporary
objects of the caller function (and so on) as well.


File: igraph_reference_manual.info,  Node: Writing igraph functions with proper error handling,  Next: Error handling and threads,  Prev: Deallocating memory,  Up: Advanced topics

5.4.4 Writing igraph functions with proper error handling
---------------------------------------------------------

There are some simple rules to keep in order to have functions behaving
well in erroneous situations. First, check the arguments of the
functions and call `IGRAPH_ERROR' (*note IGRAPH_ERROR --- Trigger an
error_::) if they are invalid. Second, call `IGRAPH_FINALLY' (*note
IGRAPH_FINALLY --- Register an object for deallocation_::) on each
dynamically allocated object and call `IGRAPH_FINALLY_CLEAN()' (*note
IGRAPH_FINALLY_CLEAN --- Signal clean deallocation of objects_::) with
the proper argument before returning. Third, use IGRAPH_CHECK on all
`igraph' function calls which can generate errors.

   The size of the stack used for this bookkeeping is fixed, and small.
If you want to allocate several objects, write a destroy function which
can deallocate all of these. See the `adjlist.c' file in the `igraph'
source for an example.

   For some functions these mechanisms are simply not flexible enough.
These functions should define their own error handlers and restore the
error handler before they return.


File: igraph_reference_manual.info,  Node: Error handling and threads,  Prev: Writing igraph functions with proper error handling,  Up: Advanced topics

5.4.5 Error handling and threads
--------------------------------

It is likely that the `igraph' error handling method is _not_
thread-safe, mainly because of the static global stack which is used to
store the address of the temporarily allocated objects. This issue
might be addressed in a later version of `igraph'.

6.1 About template types
========================

Some of the container types listed in this section are defined for many
base types. This is similar to templates in C++ and generics in Ada,
but it is implemented via precompiler macros since the C language
cannot handle it. Here is the list of template types and the all base
types they currently support:

vector
     Vector is currently defined for `igraph_real_t', `long int'
     (long), `char' (char), `igraph_bool_t' (bool). The default is
     `igraph_real_t'.

matrix
     Matrix is currently defined for `igraph_real_t', `long int'
     (long), `char' (char), `igraph_bool_t' (bool). The default is
     `igraph_real_t'.

array3

6.2.1 About igraph_vector_t objects
-----------------------------------

The `igraph_vector_t' data type is a simple and efficient interface to
arrays containing numbers. It is something similar as (but much simpler
than) the `vector' template in the C++ standard library.

   Vectors are used extensively in `igraph', all functions which expect
or return a list of numbers use igraph_vector_t to achieve this.

   The `igraph_vector_t' type usually uses O(n) space to store n
elements. Sometimes it uses more, this is because vectors can shrink,
but even if they shrink, the current implementation does not free a
single bit of memory.

   The elements in an `igraph_vector_t' object are indexed from zero,
we follow the usual C convention here.

   The elements of a vector always occupy a single block of memory, the
starting address of this memory block can be queried with the `VECTOR'
(*note VECTOR --- Accessing an element of a vector_::) macro. This way,
vector objects can be used with standard mathematical libraries, like
the GNU Scientific Library.

6.2.2 Constructors and Destructors
----------------------------------

`igraph_vector_t' objects have to be initialized before using them,
this is analogous to calling a constructor on them. There are a number
of `igraph_vector_t' constructors, for your convenience.
`igraph_vector_init()' (*note igraph_vector_init --- Initializes a
vector object [constructor]_::) is the basic constructor, it creates a
vector of the given length, filled with zeros.  `igraph_vector_copy()'
(*note igraph_vector_copy --- Initializes a vector from another vector
object [constructor]_::) creates a new identical copy of an already
existing and initialized vector. `igraph_vector_init_copy()' (*note
igraph_vector_init_copy --- Initializes a vector from an ordinary C
array [constructor]_::) creates a vector by copying a regular C array.
`igraph_vector_init_seq()' (*note igraph_vector_init_seq ---
Initializes a vector with a sequence_::) creates a vector containing a
regular sequence with increment one.

   `igraph_vector_view()' (*note igraph_vector_view --- Handle a
regular C array as a igraph_vector_t_::) is a special constructor, it
allows you to handle a regular C array as a `vector' without copying
its elements.

   If a `igraph_vector_t' object is not needed any more, it should be
destroyed to free its allocated memory by calling the `igraph_vector_t'
destructor, `igraph_vector_destroy()' (*note igraph_vector_destroy ---
Destroys a vector object_::).

   Note that vectors created by `igraph_vector_view()' (*note
igraph_vector_view --- Handle a regular C array as a
igraph_vector_t_::) are special, you mustn't call
`igraph_vector_destroy()' (*note igraph_vector_destroy --- Destroys a
vector object_::) on these.

6.2.4 Accessing elements
------------------------

The simplest way to access an element of a vector is to use the
`VECTOR' (*note VECTOR --- Accessing an element of a vector_::) macro.
This macro can be used both for querying and setting `igraph_vector_t'
elements. If you need a function, `igraph_vector_e()' (*note
igraph_vector_e --- Access an element of a vector_::) queries and
`igraph_vector_set()' (*note igraph_vector_set --- Assignment to an
element of a vector_::) sets an element of a vector.
`igraph_vector_e_ptr()' (*note igraph_vector_e_ptr --- Get the address
of an element of a vector::) returns the address of an element.

   `igraph_vector_tail()' (*note igraph_vector_tail --- Returns the
last element in a vector_::) returns the last element of a non-empty
vector. There is no `igraph_vector_head()' function however, as it is
easy to write ` VECTOR(v)[0]' instead.

...............................................................


     int igraph_vector_reserve   (igraph_vector_t* v, long int size);

   `igraph' vectors are flexible, they can grow and shrink. Growing
however occasionally needs the data in the vector to be copyed.  In
order to avoid you can call this function to reserve space for future
growth of the vector.

   Note that this function does _not_ change the size of the vector.
Let us see a small example to clarify things: if you reserve space for
100 elements and the size of your vector was (and still is) 60, then
you can surely add additional 40 elements to your vector before it will
be copied.

   *Arguments:. *

`v':
     The vector object.

`size':
     The new _allocated_ size of the vector.

   *Returns:. *

`'
     Error code: `IGRPAH_ENOMEM' if there is not enough memory.

   Note that this function does not free any memory, just sets the size
of the vector to the given one. It can on the other hand allocate more
memory if the new size is larger than the previous one. In this case
the newly appeared elements in the vector are _not_ set to zero, they
are uninitialized.

   *Arguments:. *

     int igraph_vector_push_back (igraph_vector_t* v, igraph_real_t e);

   This function resizes the vector to be one element longer and sets
the very last element in the vector to `e'.

   *Arguments:. *

     The vector object.

     The element to append to the vector.

a sequence of n subsequent calls to this function has time complexity
O(n), even if there hadn't been any space reserved for the new elements
by `igraph_vector_reserve()' (*note igraph_vector_reserve --- Reserves
memory for a vector_::). This is implemented by a trick similar to the
C++ `vector' class: each time more memory is allocated for a vector,
the size of the additionally allocated memory is the same as the
vector's current length. (We assume here that the time complexity of
memory allocation is at most linear.)

6.2.14 Pointer vectors (igraph_vector_ptr_t)
--------------------------------------------

The `igraph_vector_ptr_t' data type is very similar to the
`igraph_vector_t' type, but it stores generic pointers instead of real
numbers.

   This type has the same space complexity as `igraph_vector_t', and
most implemented operations work the same way as for `igraph_vector_t'.

   This type is mostly used to pass to or receive from a set of graphs
to some `igraph' functions, such as `igraph_decompose()' (*note
igraph_decompose --- Decompose a graph into connected components_::),
which decomposes a graph to connected components.

   The same `VECTOR' (*note VECTOR --- Accessing an element of a
vector_::) macro used for ordinary vectors can be used for pointer
vectors as well, please note that a typeless generic pointer will be
provided by this macro and you may need to cast it to a specific
pointer before starting to work with it.

   This function resizes a pointer to vector to zero length. Note that
the pointed objects are _not_ deallocated, you should call free() on
them, or make sure that their allocated memory is freed in some other
way, you'll get memory leaks otherwise.

deallocate the memory required for storing the pointers, so making a
pointer vector smaller this way does not give back any memory. This
behavior might change in the future.

6.4.1 About igraph_spmatrix_t objects
-------------------------------------

The `igraph_spmatrix_t' type stores a sparse matrix with the assumption
that the number of nonzero elements in the matrix scales linearly with
the row or column count of the matrix (so most of the elements are
zero). Of course it can store an arbitrary real matrix, but if most of
the elements are nonzero, one should use `igraph_matrix_t' instead.

   The elements are stored in column compressed format, so the elements
in the same column are stored adjacent in the computer's memory. The
storage requirement for a sparse matrix is O(n) where n is the number
of nonzero elements. Actually it can be a bit larger, see the
documentation of the vector type for an explanation.

6.8 String vectors
==================

The `igraph_strvector_t' type is a vector of strings.  The current
implementation is very simple and not too efficient. It works fine for
not too many strings, e.g. the list of attribute names is returned in a
string vector by `igraph_cattribute_list()' (*note
igraph_cattribute_list --- List all attributes::). Do not expect great
performace from this type.

File: igraph_reference_manual.info,  Node: Adjacency lists,  Prev: String vectors,  Up: Data structure library; vector; matrix; other data types

6.9 Adjacency lists
===================

Sometimes it is easier to work with a graph which is in adjacency list
format: a list of vectors; each vector contains the neighbor vertices
or adjacent edges of a given vertex. Typically, this representation is
good if we need to iterate over the neigbors of all vertices many
times. E.g. when finding the shortest paths between every pairs of
vertices or calculating closeness centrality for all the vertices.

   The `igraph_adjlist_t' stores the adjacency lists of a graph. After
creation it is independent of the original graph, it can be modified
freely with the usual vector operations, the graph is not affected.
E.g. the adjacency list can be used to rewire the edges of a graph
efficiently. If one used the straightforward `igraph_delete_edges()'
(*note igraph_delete_edges --- Removes edges from a graph_::) and
`igraph_add_edges()' (*note igraph_add_edges --- Adds edges to a graph
object_::) combination for this that needs O(|V|+|E|) time for every
single deletion and insertion operation, it is thus very slow if many
edges are rewired. Extracting the graph into an adjacency list, do all
the rewiring operations on the vectors of the adjacency list and then
creating a new graph needs (depending on how exactly the rewiring is
done) typically O(|V|+|E|) time for the whole rewiring process.

   Lazy adjacency lists are a bit different. When creating a lazy
adjacency list, the neighbors of the vertices are not queried, only
some memory is allocated for the vectors. When
`igraph_lazy_adjlist_get()' (*note igraph_lazy_adjlist_get --- Query
neighbor vertices::) is called for vertex v the first time, the
neighbors of v are queried and stored in a vector of the adjacency
list, so they don't need to be queried again. Lazy adjacency lists are
handy if you have an at least linear operation (because initialization
is generally linear in terms of number of vertices), but you don't know
how many vertices you will visit during the computation.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     An uninitialized graph object.

`edges':
     The edges to add, the first two elements are the first edge, etc.

`n':
     The number of vertices in the graph, if smaller or equal to the
     highest vertex id in the `edges' vector it will be increased
     automatically. So it is safe to give 0 here.

`directed':
     Boolean, whether to create a directed graph or not. If yes, then
     the first edge points from the first vertex id in `edges' to the
     second, etc.

   *Returns:. *

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


     int igraph_small(igraph_t *graph, igraph_integer_t n, igraph_bool_t directed,
     		 ...);

   This function is handy when a relatively small graph needs to be
created.  Instead giving the edges in vector, they are given simply as
arguments and a '-1' needs to be given after the last meaningful edge
argument.

   Note that only graphs which have vertices less than the highest
value of the 'int' type can be created this way. If you give larger
values then the result is undefined.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     Pointer to an uninitialized graph object, the result will be
     stored here.

`n':
     The number of vertices in the graph, an integer.

`directed':
     Logical constant, gives whether the graph should be directed.

`...':
     The additional arguments giving the edges of the graph. Don't
     forget to supply an additional '-1' after the last (meaningful)
     argument.

   *Returns:. *

`'
     Error code.

of edges in the graph to create.

`adjmatrix':
     The adjacency matrix. How it is interpreted depends on the `mode'

structure, it is recommended that you convert the graph into and
adjacency list via `igraph_adjlist_init()' (*note igraph_adjlist_init

7.1.12 igraph_famous -- Create a famous graph by simply providing its name
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


     int igraph_famous(igraph_t *graph, const char *name);

   The name of the graph can be simply supplied as a string.  Note that
this function creates graphs which don't take any parameters, there are
separate functions for graphs with parameters, eg. `igraph_full()'
(*note igraph_full --- Creates a full graph [directed or undirected;
with or without loops]_::) for creating a full graph.

   The following graphs are supported:

`Bull'
     The bull graph, 5 vertices, 5 edges, resembles to the head of a
     bull if drawn properly.

`Chvatal '
     This is the smallest triangle-free graph that is both 4-chromatic
     and 4-regular. According to the Grunbaum conjecture there exists
     an m-regular, m-chromatic graph with n vertices for every m>1 and
     n>2. The Chvatal graph is an example for m=4 and n=12. It has 24
     edges.

`Coxeter '
     A non-Hamiltonian cubic symmetric graph with 28 vertices and 42
     edges.

`Cubical'
     The Platonic graph of the cube. A convex regular polyhedron with 8
     vertices and 12 edges.

`Diamond'
     A graph with 4 vertices and 5 edges, resembles to a schematic
     diamond if drawn properly.

`Dodecahedral, Dodecahedron'
     Another Platonic solid with 20 vertices and 30 edges.

`Folkman '
     The semisymmetric graph with minimum number of vertices, 20 and 40
     edges. A semisymmetric graph is regular, edge transitive and not
     vertex transitive.

`Franklin '
     This is a graph whose embedding to the Klein bottle can be colored
     with six colors, it is a counterexample to the neccessity of the
     Heawood conjecture on a Klein bottle. It has 12 vertices and 18
     edges.

`Frucht '
     The Frucht Graph is the smallest cubical graph whose automorphism
     group consists only of the identity element. It has 12 vertices
     and 18 edges.

`Grotzsch '
     The Gro"tzsch graph is a triangle-free graph with 11 vertices, 20
     edges, and chromatic number 4. It is named after German
     mathematician Herbert Gro"tzsch, and its existence demonstrates
     that the assumption of planarity is necessary in Gro"tzsch's
     theorem that every triangle-free planar graph is 3-colorable.

`Heawood '
     The Heawood graph is an undirected graph with 14 vertices and 21
     edges. The graph is cubic, and all cycles in the graph have six or
     more edges. Every smaller cubic graph has shorter cycles, so this
     graph is the 6-cage, the smallest cubic graph of girth 6.

`Herschel '
     The Herschel graph is the smallest nonhamiltonian polyhedral
     graph. It is the unique such graph on 11 nodes, and has 18 edges.

`House'
     The house graph is a 5-vertex, 6-edge graph, the schematic draw of
     a house if drawn properly, basicly a triangle of the top of a
     square.

`HouseX'
     The same as the house graph with an X in the square. 5 vertices
     and 8 edges.

`Icosahedral, Icosahedron '
     A Platonic solid with 12 vertices and 30 edges.

`Krackhardt_Kite'
     A social network with 10 vertices and 18 edges.  Krackhardt, D.

     in Organizations.  Admin. Sci. Quart. 35, 342-369, 1990.

`Levi '
     The graph is a 4-arc transitive cubic graph, it has 30 vertices
     and 45 edges.

`McGee '
     The McGee graph is the unique 3-regular 7-cage graph, it has 24
     vertices and 36 edges.

`Meredith '
     The Meredith graph is a quartic graph on 70 nodes and 140 edges
     that is a counterexample to the conjecture that every 4-regular
     4-connected graph is Hamiltonian.

`Noperfectmatching '
     A connected graph with 16 vertices and 27 edges containing no
     perfect matching. A matching in a graph is a set of pairwise
     non-adjacent edges; that is, no two edges share a common vertex. A
     perfect matching is a matching which covers all vertices of the
     graph.

`Nonline '
     A graph whose connected components are the 9 graphs whose presence
     as a vertex-induced subgraph in a graph makes a nonline graph. It
     has 50 vertices and 72 edges.

`Octahedral, Octahedron '
     Platonic solid with 6 vertices and 12 edges.

`Petersen'
     A 3-regular graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges. It is the
     smallest hypohamiltonian graph, ie. it is non-hamiltonian but
     removing any single vertex from it makes it Hamiltonian.

`Robertson '
     The unique (4,5)-cage graph, ie. a 4-regular graph of girth 5. It
     has 19 vertices and 38 edges.

`Smallestcyclicgroup '
     A smallest nontrivial graph whose automorphism group is cyclic. It
     has 9 vertices and 15 edges.

`Tetrahedral, Tetrahedron '
     Platonic solid with 4 vertices and 6 edges.

`Thomassen '
     The smallest hypotraceable graph, on 34 vertices and 52 edges. A
     hypotracable graph does not contain a Hamiltonian path but after
     removing any single vertex from it the remainder always contains a
     Hamiltonian path. A graph containing a Hamiltonian path is called
     tracable.

`Tutte '
     Tait's Hamiltonian graph conjecture states that every 3-connected
     3-regular planar graph is Hamiltonian.  This graph is a
     counterexample. It has 46 vertices and 69 edges.

`Uniquely3colorable '
     Returns a 12-vertex, triangle-free graph with chromatic number 3
     that is uniquely 3-colorable.

`Walther '

   A de Bruijn graph represents relationships between strings. An
alphabet of `m' letters are used and strings of length `n' are
considered.  A vertex corresponds to every possible string and there is
a directed edge from vertex `v' to vertex `w' if the string of `v' can
be transformed into the string of `w' by removing its first letter and
appending a letter to it.

   Please note that the graph will have `m' to the power `n' vertices
and even more edges, so probably you don't want to supply too big
numbers for `m' and `n'.

edges specified by a matrix. Let p denote the number of columns in the
`W' matrix. The extra edges of vertex i are added according to column

   This function adds new edges to graph. For each vertex vertices
reachable by at most `order' steps and not yet connected to the vertex
a new edge is created.

   Note that the input graph is modified in place, no new graph is
created, call `igraph_copy()' (*note igraph_copy --- Creates an exact
[deep] copy of a graph_::) if you want to keep the original graph as
well.

   For undirected graphs reachability is always symmetric, if vertex A
can be reached from vertex B in at most `order' steps, then the

     for directed graphs. If `IGRAPH_OUT' then vertices reachable from
     the source vertex will be connected, `IGRAPH_IN' is the opposite.

   A geometric random graph is created by dropping points (=vertices)
randomly to the unit square and then connecting all those pairs which

   Original code contributed by Keith Briggs, thanks Keith.

   *Arguments:. *

`nodes':
     The number of vertices in the graph.

`radius':
     The radius within which the vertices will be connected.

`torus':
     Logical constant, if true periodic boundary conditions will be
     used, ie. the vertices are assumed to be on a torus instead of a
     square.

     			 igraph_bool_t directed);

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     An uninitialized graph object.

`n':
     The number of vertices in the graph.

`m':
     The number of outgoing edges generated for each vertex. (Only if
     `outseq' is `NULL'.)

`outseq':
     Gives the (out-)degrees of the vertices. If this is constant, this
     can be a NULL pointer or an empty (but initialized!) vector, in
     this case `m' contains the constant out-degree. The very first
     vertex has by definition no outgoing edges, so the first number in
     this vector is ignored.

`outpref':
     Boolean, if true not only the in- but also the out-degree of a
     vertex increases its citation probability. Ie. the citation
     probability is determined by the total degree of the vertices.

`directed':
     Boolean, whether to generate a directed graph.

   *Returns:. *

`'
     Error code: `IGRAPH_EINVAL': invalid `n', `m' or `outseq'
     parameter.

   Time complexity: O(|V|+|E|), the number of vertices plus the number

     				   igraph_bool_t outpref,
     				   igraph_real_t zeroappeal,
     				   igraph_bool_t directed);

   This function is very similar to `igraph_barabasi_game()' (*note
igraph_barabasi_game --- Generates a graph based on the
Baraba'si-Albert model_::), only in this game the probability that a
new vertex attaches to a given old vertex is not proportional to the
degree of the old node, but some power of the degree of the old node.

   More precisely the attachment probability is the degree to the power
of `power' plus `zeroappeal'.

   This function might generate graphs with multiple edges if the value
of `m' is at least two. You can call `igraph_simplify()' (*note
igraph_simplify --- Removes loop and/or multiple edges from the
graph_::) to get rid of the multiple edges.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     Pointer to an uninitialized graph object, the generated graph will
     be stored here.

`n':
     The number of vertices in the generated graph.

`power':
     The power of the preferential attachment.

`m':
     The number of edges to generate in each time step, if the `outseq'
     parameter is a null vector or a vector with length zero. It is
     ignored otherwise.

`outseq':
     The number of edges to generate in each time step. For directed

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     Pointer to an uninitialized graph object.

`out_deg':
     The degree sequence for an undirected graph (if `in_seq' is of
     length zero), or the out-degree sequence of a directed graph (if
     `in_deq' is not of length zero.

`in_deg':
     It is either a zero-length vector or `NULL' (if an undirected
     graph is generated), or the in-degree sequence.

`method':
     The method to generate the graph. Possible values:
     `IGRAPH_DEGSEQ_SIMPLE', for undirected graphs this method puts all
     vertex ids in a bag, the multiplicity of a vertex in the bag is
     the same as its degree. Then it draws pairs from the bag, until it
     is empty. This method can generate both loop (self) edges and
     multiple edges.  For directed graphs, the algorithm is basically
     the same, but two separate bags are used for the in- and
     out-degrees.  `IGRAPH_DEGSEQ_VL' is a much more sophisticated
     generator, that can sample undirected, connected simple graphs
     uniformly.  It uses Monte-Carlo methods to randomize the graphs.
     This generator should be favoured if undirected and connected
     graphs are to be generated. igraph uses the original implementation
     Fabien Viger; see http://www-rp.lip6.fr/~latapy/FV/generation.html
     (http://www-rp.lip6.fr/~latapy/FV/generation.html) and the paper
     cited on it for the details of the algorithm.

   *Returns:. *

`'
     Error code: `IGRAPH_ENOMEM': there is not enough memory to perform
     the operation.  `IGRAPH_EINVAL': invalid method parameter, or
     invalid in- and/or out-degree vectors. The degree vectors should
     be non-negative, `out_deg' should sum up to an even integer for
     undirected graphs; the length and sum of `out_deg' and `in_deg'

of edges.

     			    igraph_integer_t pambs, igraph_bool_t directed);

   The forest fire model intends to reproduce the following network
characteristics, observed in real networks:

   * Heavy-tailed in-degree distribution.

   * Heavy-tailed out-degree distribution.

   * Communities.

   * Densification power-law. The network is densifying in time,
     according to a power-law rule.

   * Shrinking diameter. The diameter of the network decreases in time.

   The network is generated in the following way. One vertex is added at
a time. This vertex connects to (cites) ` ambs'  vertices already
present in the network, chosen uniformly random. Now, for each cited
vertex ` v'  we do the following procedure:

  1. We generate two random number, ` x'  and ` y' , that are
     geometrically distributed with means ` p/(1-p)'  and ` rp(1-rp)' .
     (` p'  is ` fw_prob' , ` r'  is ` bw_factor' .) The new vertex
     cites ` x'  outgoing neighbors and ` y'  incoming neighbors of `
     v' , from those which are not yet cited by the new vertex. If
     there are less than ` x'  or ` y'  such vertices available then we
     cite all of them.

  2. The same procedure is applied to all the newly cited vertices.

   Note however, that the version of the model in the published paper
is incorrect in the sense that it cannot generate the kind of graphs
the authors claim. A corrected version is available from
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jure/pubs/powergrowth-tkdd.pdf, our
implementation is based on this.

   *Arguments:. *

     The number of vertices in the graph.

`fw_prob':

     The number of ambassador vertices.

`directed':
     Whether to create a directed graph.

by its (in-)degree (k) and age (l). This probability has a degree
dependent component multiplied by an age dependent component. The
degree dependent part is: `deg_coef' times k to the power of `pa_exp'
plus `zero_deg_appeal'; and the age dependent part is `age_coef' times
l to the power of `aging_exp' plus `zero_age_appeal'.

   The age is based on the number of vertices in the network and the
`aging_bin' argument: vertices grew one unit older after each
`aging_bin' vertices added to the network.

`graph':
     Pointer to an uninitialized graph object.

`nodes':
     The number of vertices in the graph.

     contribute to the probability to gain a new edge.

`pa_exp':
     The exponent of the preferential attachment, a small positive

     The degree dependent part of the attractiveness of the zero degree
     vertices.

`zero_age_appeal':

     age zero. This parameter is usually zero.

`deg_coef':
     The coefficient for the degree.

`age_coef':
     The coefficient for the age.

   This game is very similar to `igraph_barabasi_aging_game()' (*note

     counted. Normally it is false.

`pa_exp':
     The exponent for the preferential attachment.

`aging_exp':

     vertices is incremented by one after every `aging_bin' vertex
     added.

`time_window':
     The time window to use to count the number of adjacent edges for
     the vertices.

`zero_appeal':
     The degree dependent part of the attractiveness for zero degree
     vertices.

   Function to create a network based on some vertex categories. This
function creates a citation network, in each step a single vertex and
`edges_per_step' citating edges are added, nodes with different
categories (may) have different probabilities to get cited, as given by

   An evolving citation network is modeled here, a single vertex and
its `edges_per_step' citation are added in each time step. The odds the
a given vertex is cited by the new vertex depends on the category of
both the citing and the cited vertex and is given in the `pref' matrix.
The categories of the citing vertex correspond to the rows, the
categories of the cited vertex to the columns of this matrix. Ie. the
element in row `i' and column `j' gives the probability that a `j'
vertex is cited, if the category of the citing vertex is `i'.

8.1 About selectors, iterators
==============================

Everything about vertices and vertex selectors also applies to edges
and edge selectors unless explicitly noted otherwise.

   The vertex (and edge) selector notion was introduced in igraph 0.2,
and it is a way to reference to sequence of vertices or edges
independently of the graph.

   While this might sound quite mysterious, it is actually very simple.
For example all vertex of graph can be selected by `igraph_vs_all()'
(*note igraph_vs_all --- Vertex set; all vertices of a graph_::), and
the graph independence means that `igraph_vs_all()' (*note
igraph_vs_all --- Vertex set; all vertices of a graph_::) is not
parametrized by a graph object. Ie.  `igraph_vs_all()' (*note
igraph_vs_all --- Vertex set; all vertices of a graph_::) is the
_concept_ of selecting all vertices of a graph.

   This means that for determining the actual vertex id's implied by a
vertex selector it needs to be instantiated with a graph object, the
instantiation results a vertex iterator.

   Some vertex selectors have _immediate_ versions, these have prefix `
igraph_vss'  instead of ` igraph_vs' , eg.  `igraph_vss_all()' (*note
igraph_vss_all --- All vertices of a graph [immediate version]_::)
instead of `igraph_vs_all()' (*note igraph_vs_all --- Vertex set; all
vertices of a graph_::).  These immediate versions are to be used in
the parameter list of the igraph functions, like `igraph_degree()'
(*note igraph_degree --- The degree of some vertices in a graph_::).
These functions are not associated with any `igraph_vs_t' object, so
they have no separate constructors and destructors (destroy functions).

8.2 Vertex selector constructors
================================

Vertex selectors are created by vertex selector constructors, can be
instantiated with `igraph_vit_create()' (*note igraph_vit_create ---
Creates a vertex iterator from a vertex selector_::), and are destroyed
with `igraph_vs_destroy()' (*note igraph_vs_destroy --- Destroy a
vertex set_::).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------


     int igraph_vit_create(const igraph_t *graph,
     		      igraph_vs_t vs, igraph_vit_t *vit);

   This function instantiates a vertex selector object with a given
graph. This is the step when the actual vertex ids are created from the
_logical_ notion of the vertex selector based on the graph.  Eg. a
vertex selector created with `igraph_vs_all()' (*note igraph_vs_all ---
Vertex set; all vertices of a graph_::) contains knowledge that _all_
vertices are included in a (yet indefinite) graph. When instantiating
it a vertex iterator object is created, this contains the actual vertex
ids in the graph supplied as a parameter.

   The same vertex selector object can be used to instantiate any
number vertex iterators.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     An `igraph_t' object, a graph.

`vs':
     A vertex selector object.

`vit':
     Pointer to an uninitialized vertex iterator object.

   *Returns:. *

`'
     Error code.

   *See also:. *

`'
     `igraph_vit_destroy()' (*note igraph_vit_destroy --- Destroys a
     vertex iterator_::).

   Time complexity: it depends on the vertex selector type. O(1) for
vertex selectors created with `igraph_vs_all()' (*note igraph_vs_all
--- Vertex set; all vertices of a graph_::), `igraph_vs_none()' (*note

8.5.3 Stepping over the vertices
--------------------------------

After creating an iterator with `igraph_vit_create()' (*note
igraph_vit_create --- Creates a vertex iterator from a vertex
selector_::), it points to the first vertex in the vertex determined by
the vertex selector (if there is any). The `IGRAPH_VIT_NEXT()' (*note
IGRAPH_VIT_NEXT --- Next vertex_::) macro steps to the next vertex,
`IGRAPH_VIT_END()' (*note IGRAPH_VIT_END --- Are we at the end?::)
checks whether there are more vertices to visit, `IGRAPH_VIT_SIZE()'
(*note IGRAPH_VIT_SIZE --- Size of a vertex iterator_::) gives the
total size of the vertices visited so far and to be visited.
`IGRAPH_VIT_RESET()' (*note IGRAPH_VIT_RESET --- Reset a vertex
iterator_::) resets the iterator, it will point to the first vertex
again. Finally `IGRAPH_VIT_GET()' (*note IGRAPH_VIT_GET --- Query the
current position_::) gives the current vertex pointed by the iterator
(call this only if `IGRAPH_VIT_END()' (*note IGRAPH_VIT_END --- Are we
at the end?::) is false).

   Here is an example on how to step over the neighbors of vertex 0:


     igraph_vs_t vs;
     igraph_vit_t vit;
     ...
     igraph_vs_adj(&vs, 0, IGRAPH_ALL);
     igraph_vit_create(&graph, vs, &vit);
     while (!IGRAPH_VIT_END(vit)) {
       printf(" %li", (long int) IGRAPH_VIT_GET(vit));
       IGRAPH_VIT_NEXT(vit);
     }
     printf("\n");
     ...

9 Graph, Vertex and Edge Attributes
***********************************

Attributes are numbers or strings (or basically any kind of data)
associated with the vertices or edges of a graph, or with the graph
itself. Eg. you may label vertices with symbolic names or attach
numeric weights to the edges of a graph.

   igraph attributes are designed to be flexible and extensible.  In
igraph attributes are implemented via an interface abstraction: any
type implementing the functions in the interface, can be used for
storing vertex, edge and graph attributes. This means that different
attribute implementations can be used together with igraph. This is
reasonable: if igraph is used from Python attributes can be of any
Python type, from GNU R all R types are allowed. There is an
experimental attribute implementation to be used when programming in C,
but by default it is currently turned off.

   First we briefly look over how attribute handlers can be
implemented. This is not something a user does every day. It is rather
typically the job of the high level interface writers. (But it is
possible to write an interface without implementing attributes.) Then
we show the experimental C attribute handler.

9.1 The Attribute Handler Interface
===================================

It is possible to attach an attribute handling interface to `igraph'.
This is simply a table of functions, of type `igraph_attribute_table_t'
(*note igraph_attribute_table_t --- Table of functions to perform
operations on attributes::). These functions are invoked to notify the
attribute handling code about the structural changes in a graph. See
the documentation of this type for details.

   By default there is no attribute interface attached to `igraph', to
attach one, call `igraph_i_set_attribute_table' (*note
igraph_i_set_attribute_table --- Attach an attribute table_::) with
your new table.

   This type collects the functions defining an attribute handler.  It
has the following members:

   *Values:. *

`init':
     This function is called whenever a new graph object is created,
     right after it is created but before any vertices or edges are
     added. It is supposed to set the `attr' member of the `igraph_t'
     object. It is expected to return an error code.

`destroy':
     This function is called whenever the graph object is destroyed,
     right before freeing the allocated memory.

`copy':
     This function is called when copying a graph with `igraph_copy'
     (*note igraph_copy --- Creates an exact [deep] copy of a
     graph_::), after the structure of the graph has been already
     copied. It is expected to return an error code.

`add_vertices':
     Called when vertices are added to a graph, before adding the
     vertices themselves.  The number of vertices to add is supplied as
     an argument. Expected to return an error code.

`delete_vertices':
     Called when vertices are deleted from the graph. Two additional
     parameters are supplied, the first is a recoding vector for edge
     ids, the second is one for the vertex ids. The edge recoding
     vector gives for each edge its id in the new graph. It contains
     one number for each edge (in the original graph): zero means that
     the edge has been deleted, otherwise the new id plus one is
     included. The vertex recoding vector contains the same for
     vertices.

`add_edges':
     Called when new edges have been added. The number of new edges are
     supplied as well. It is expected to return an error code.

`delete_edges':
     Called when edges were deleted. The edge recoding vector is
     supplied, in the same form as for the `delete_vertices' function.

`permute_edges':
     Typically called when a new graph is created and some of the new
     edges should carry the attributes of some of the old edges. The
     idx vector shows the mapping between the old edges and the new
     ones. Its length is the same as the number of edges in the new
     graph, and for each edge it gives the id of the old edge (the edge
     in the old graph).

`get_info':
     Query the attributes of a graph, the names and types should be
     returned.

`has_attr':
     Check whether a graph has the named graph/vertex/edge attribute.

`gettype':
     Query the type of a graph/vertex/edge attribute.

`get_numeric_graph_attr':
     Query a numeric graph attribute. The value should be placed as the
     first element of the `value' vector.

`get_string_graph_attr':
     Query a string graph attribute. The value should be placed as the
     first element of the `value' string vector.

`get_numeric_vertex_attr':
     Query a numeric vertex attribute, for the vertices included in
     `vs'.

`get_string_vertex_attr':
     Query a string vertex attribute, for the vertices included in `vs'.

`get_numeric_edge_attr':
     Query a numeric edge attribute, for the edges included in `es'.

`get_string_edge_attr':
     Query a string edge attribute, for the edge included in `es'.

   Note that the `get_*_*_attr' are allowed to convert the attributes
to numeric or string. E.g. if a vertex attribute is a GNU R complex
data type, then `get_string_vertex_attribute' may serialize it into a
string, but this probably makes sense only if `add_vertices' is able to
deserialize it.

   Note that this is only the type communicated by the attribute
interface towards igraph functions. Eg. in the GNU R attribute handler,
it is safe to say that all complex R object attributes are strings, as
long as this interface is able to serialize them into strings. See also
`igraph_attribute_table_t' (*note igraph_attribute_table_t --- Table of
functions to perform operations on attributes::).

   *Values:. *

`IGRAPH_ATTRIBUTE_DEFAULT':
     Currently not used for anything.

`IGRAPH_ATTRIBUTE_NUMERIC':
     Numeric attribute.

`IGRAPH_ATTRIBUTE_STRING':
     Attribute that can be converted to a string.

`IGRAPH_ATTRIBUTE_R_OBJECT':
     An R object. This is usually ignored by the igraph functions.

`IGRAPH_ATTRIBUTE_PY_OBJECT':
     A Python object. Usually ignored by the igraph functions.


File: igraph_reference_manual.info,  Node: Accessing attributes from C,  Prev: The Attribute Handler Interface,  Up: Graph; Vertex and Edge Attributes

9.2 Accessing attributes from C
===============================

There is an experimental attribute handler that can be used from C
code. In this section we show how this works. This attribute handler is
by default not attached (the default is no attribute handler), so we
first need to attach it:


     igraph_i_set_attribute_table(&igraph_cattribute_table);

   Now the attribute functions are available. Please note that the
attribute handler must be attached before you call any other igraph
functions, otherwise you might end up with graphs without attributes
and an active attribute handler, which might cause unexpected program
behaviour. The rule is that you attach the attribute handler in the
beginning of your `main()' and never touch it again. (Detaching the
attribute handler might lead to memory leaks.)

   It is not currently possible to have attribute handlers on a
per-graph basis. All graphs in an application must be managed with the
same attribute handler. (Including the default case when there is no
attribute handler at all.

   The C attribute handler supports attaching real numbers and
character strings as attributes. No vectors are allowed, ie. every
vertex might have an attribute called ` name' , but it is not possible
to have a ` coords'  graph (or other) attribute which is a vector of
numbers.

          the lengths of the incoming paths are calculated.

    `IGRAPH_ALL '
          the directed graph is considered as an undirected one for the
          computation.

   This function is Dijkstra's algorithm to find the weighted shortest
paths to all vertices from a single source. (It is run independently
for the given sources.) It uses a binary heap for efficient
implementation.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     The input graph, can be directed.

`res':
     The result, a matrix. Each row contains the distances from a
     single source, in the order of vertex ids.  Unreachable vertices
     has distance `IGRAPH_INFINITY'.

`from':
     The source vertices.

`weights':
     The edge weights. They must be all non-negative for Dijkstra's
     algorithm to work. An error code is returned if there is a
     negative edge weight in the weight vector. If this is a null
     pointer, then the unweighted version, `igraph_shortest_paths()'

     directions completely (`IGRAPH_ALL'). It is ignored for undirected
     graphs.

   *Returns:. *

   This function is the Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the weighted

weights, you are better off with `igraph_shortest_paths_dijkstra()'

`weights':

     that has a negative total weight (since this would allow us to
     decrease the weight of any path containing at least a single
     vertex of this loop infinitely). If this is a null pointer, then
     the unweighted version, `igraph_shortest_paths()' (*note
     igraph_shortest_paths --- The length of the shortest paths between

`igraph_shortest_paths()' (*note igraph_shortest_paths --- The length

   The current implementation works for undirected graphs only,
directed graphs are treated as undirected graphs. Loop edges and
multiple edges are ignored.

   If the graph is a forest (ie. acyclic), then zero is returned.

   This implementation is based on Alon Itai and Michael Rodeh: Finding
a minimum circuit in a graph _ Proceedings of the ninth annual ACM
symposium on Theory of computing _, 1-10, 1977. The first
implementation of this function was done by Keith Briggs, thanks Keith.

   *Arguments:. *

`girth':
     Pointer to an integer, if not `NULL' then the result will be
     stored here.

`circle':
     Pointer to an initialized vector, the vertex ids in the shortest
     circle will be stored here. If `NULL' then it is ignored.

   *Returns:. *

`'
     Error code.

   Time complexity: O((|V|+|E|)^2), |V| is the number of vertices, |E|
is the number of edges in the general case. If the graph has no circles
at all then the function needs O(|V|+|E|) time to realize this and then
it stops.

`graph':
     The original graph.

`components':
     This pointer vector will contain pointers to the subcomponent
     graphs. It should be initialized before calling this function and

   A graph is biconnected if the removal of any single vertex (and its
adjacent edges) does not disconnect it.

   A biconnected component of a graph is a maximal biconnected subgraph
of it. The biconnected components of a graph can be given by the
partition of its edges: every edge is a member of exactly one
biconnected component. Note that this is not true for vertices: the
same vertex can be part of many biconnected components.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     The input graph

`no':
     The number of biconnected components will be stored here.

`components':
     If not a NULL points, then the found components are stored here,
     in a list of vectors. Every vector in the list is a biconnected
     component, represented by its edges. More precisely, a spanning
     tree of the biconnected component is returned.  Note you'll have to
     destroy each vector first by calling `igraph_vector_destroy()'
     (*note igraph_vector_destroy --- Destroys a vector object_::) and
     then ` free()'  on it, plus you need to call
     `igraph_vector_ptr_destroy()' (*note igraph_vector_ptr_destroy ---
     Destroys a pointer vector_::) on the list to regain all allocated
     memory.

`articulation_points':
     If not a NULL pointer, then the articulation points of the graph
     are stored in this vector.  A vertex is an articulation point if
     its removal increases the number of (weakly) connected components
     in the graph.

reached from the other vertices). It is defined as the number of the
number of vertices minus one divided by the sum of the lengths of all

     		    igraph_arpack_options_t *options);

   This is the new PageRank implementation, based on the ARPACK
library. The old, power-method based implementation can be used as
well, it is kept under the name `igraph_pagerank_old()' (*note
igraph_pagerank_old --- Calculates the Google PageRank for the
specified vertices_::).

   Please note that the PageRank of a given vertex depends on the
PageRank of all other vertices, so even if you want to calculate the
PageRank for only some of the vertices, all of them must be calculated.
Requesting the PageRank for only some of the vertices does not result
in any performance increase at all.

   Since the calculation is an iterative process, the algorithm is
stopped after a given count of iterations or if the PageRank value
differences between iterations are less than a predefined value.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     The graph object.

`vector':
     Pointer to an initialized vector, the result is stored here. It is

     Pointer to a real variable, the eigenvalue corresponding to the
     PageRank vector is stored here. It should be always exactly one.

`directed':
     Boolean, whether to consider the directedness of the edges. This
     is ignored for undirected graphs.

`damping':
     The damping factor ("d" in the original paper)

`weights':
     Optional edge weights, it is either a null pointer, then the edges
     are not weighted, or a vector of the same length as the number of
     edges.

`options':
     Options to ARPACK. See `igraph_arpack_options_t' (*note
     igraph_arpack_options_t --- Options for ARPACK::) for details.
     Note that the function overwrites the ` n'  (number of vertices),
     ` nev'  (1), ` ncv'  (3) and ` which'  (LM) parameters and it
     always starts the calculation from a non-random vector calculated
     based on the degree of the vertices.

   *Returns:. *

igraph versions earlier than 0.5. Please use the new implementation
`igraph_pagerank()' (*note igraph_pagerank --- Calculates the Google

   Please note that the PageRank of a given vertex depends on the
PageRank of all other vertices, so even if you want to calculate the

Requesting the PageRank for only some of the vertices does not result

`damping':

`old':
     Boolean, whether to use the pre-igraph 0.5 way to calculate page
     rank. Not recommended for new applications, only included for
     compatibility. If this is non-zero then the damping factor is not
     divided by the number of vertices before adding it to the weighted
     page rank scores to calculate the new scores. I.e. the formula in
     the original PageRank paper is used. Furthermore, if this is
     non-zero then the PageRank vector is renormalized after each
     iteration.

   *Returns:. *

`'
     Error code: `IGRAPH_ENOMEM', not enough memory for temporary data.
     `IGRAPH_EINVVID', invalid vertex id in `vids'.

     int igraph_constraint(const igraph_t *graph, igraph_vector_t *res,

   This function calculates Burt's constraint scores for the given
vertices, also known as structural holes.

   Burt's constraint is higher if ego has less, or mutually stronger
related (i.e. more redundant) contacts. Burt's measure of constraint,
C[i], of vertex i's ego network V[i], is defined for directed and
valued graphs,

     C[i] = sum( sum( (p[i,q] p[q,j])^2, q in V[i], q != i,j ), j in
     V[], j != i)

for a graph of order (ie. number od vertices) N, where proportional tie
strengths are defined as

     p[i,j]=(a[i,j]+a[j,i]) / sum(a[i,k]+a[k,i], k in V[i], k != i),

a[i,j] are elements of A and the latter being the graph adjacency
matrix. For isolated vertices, constraint is undefined.

                                   igraph_integer_t cutoff);

   The closeness centrality of a vertex measures how easily other
vertices can be reached from it (or the other way: how easily it can be
reached from the other vertices). It is defined as the number of the
number of vertices minus one divided by the sum of the lengths of all
geodesics from/to the given vertex. When estimating closeness
centrality, igraph considers paths having a length less than or equal
to a prescribed cutoff value.

   If the graph is not connected, and there is no such path between two
vertices, the number of vertices is used instead the length of the
geodesic. This is always longer than the longest possible geodesic.

   Since the estimation considers vertex pairs with a distance greater
than the given value as disconnected, the resulting estimation will
always be lower than the actual closeness centrality.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     The graph object.

`res':
     The result of the computation, a vector containing the closeness
     centrality scores for the given vertices.

`vids':
     Vector giving the vertices for which the closeness centrality
     scores will be computed.

`mode':
     The type of shortest paths to be used for the calculation in
     directed graphs. Possible values:

    `IGRAPH_OUT '
          the lengths of the outgoing paths are calculated.

    `IGRAPH_IN '
          the lengths of the incoming paths are calculated.

    `IGRAPH_ALL'
          the directed graph is considered as an undirected one for the
          computation.

`cutoff':
     The maximal length of paths that will be considered.  If zero or
     negative, the exact closeness will be calculated (no upper limit
     on path lengths).

   *Returns:. *

`'
     Error code:

    `IGRAPH_ENOMEM'

   The betweenness centrality of a vertex is the number of geodesics
going through it. If there are more than one geodesic between two
vertices, the value of these geodesics are weighted by one over the
number of geodesics. When estimating betweenness centrality, igraph
takes into consideration only those paths that are shorter than or
equal to a prescribed length. Note that the estimated centrality will
always be less than the real one.

-------------------------------------------------------------------


     int igraph_laplacian(const igraph_t *graph, igraph_matrix_t *res,
     		     igraph_bool_t normalized);

   The graph Laplacian matrix is similar to an adjacency matrix but
contains -1's instead of 1's and the vertex degrees are included in the
diagonal. So the result for edge i-j is -1 if i!=j and is equal to the
degree of vertex i if i==j. igraph_laplacian will work on a directed
graph (although this does not seem to make much sense) and ignores
loops.

   The normalized version of the Laplacian matrix has 1 in the diagonal
and -1/sqrt(d[i]d[j]) if there is an edge from i to j.

   The first version of this function was written by Vincent Matossian.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':

     int igraph_topological_sorting(const igraph_t* graph, igraph_vector_t *res,

   A topological sorting of a directed acyclic graph is a linear
ordering of its nodes where each node comes before all nodes to which
it has edges. Every DAG has at least one topological sort, and may have
many.  This function returns a possible topological sort among them. If
the graph is not acyclic (it has at least one cycle), a partial
topological sort is returned and a warning is issued.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     The input graph.

`res':
     Pointer to a vector, the result will be stored here.  It will be
     resized if needed.

`mode':
     Specifies how to use the direction of the edges.  For
     `IGRAPH_OUT', the sorting order ensures that each node comes
     before all nodes to which it has edges, so nodes with no incoming
     edges go first. For `IGRAPH_IN', it is quite the opposite: each
     node comes before all nodes from which it receives edges. Nodes
     with no outgoing edges go first.

   *Returns:. *

L(G) has one vertex for each edge in G and two vertices in L(G) are
connected by an edge if their corresponding edges share an end point.

   The line graph L(G) of a G directed graph is slightly different,

corresponding edge is the same as the source of the second vertex's
corresponding edge.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


     int igraph_largest_cliques(const igraph_t *graph, igraph_vector_ptr_t *res);

   A clique is largest (quite intuitively) if there is no other clique
in the graph which contains more vertices.

   Note that this is not neccessarily the same as a maximal clique, ie.
the largest cliques are always maximal but a maximal clique is not
always largest.

     int igraph_maximal_cliques(const igraph_t *graph, igraph_vector_ptr_t *res);

   A maximal clique is a clique which can't be extended any more by
adding a new vertex to it. This is actually implemented by looking for
a maximal independent vertex set in the complementer of the graph.

   If you are only interested in the size of the largest clique in the
graph, use `igraph_clique_number()' (*note igraph_clique_number ---

File: igraph_reference_manual.info,  Node: The simple interface,  Next: The BLISS algorithm,  Up: Graph Isomorphism

12.1 The simple interface
=========================

igraph provides four set of functions to deal with graph isomorphism
problems.

   The `igraph_isomorphic()' (*note igraph_isomorphic --- Decides
whether two graphs are isomorphic::) and `igraph_subisomorphic()'
(*note igraph_subisomorphic --- Decide subgraph isomorphism::)
functions make up the first set (in addition with the
`igraph_permute_vertices()' (*note igraph_permute_vertices --- Permute
the vertices::) function). These functions choose the algorithm which
is best for the supplied input graph. (The choice is not very
sophisticated though, see their documentation for details.)

   The VF2 graph (and subgraph) isomorphism algorithm is implemented in
igraph, these functions are the second set. See
`igraph_isomorphic_vf2()' (*note igraph_isomorphic_vf2 --- Isomorphism
via VF2::) and `igraph_subisomorphic_vf2()' (*note
igraph_subisomorphic_vf2 --- Decide subgraph isomorphism using VF2::)
for starters.

   Functions for the BLISS algorithm constitute the third set, see
`igraph_isomorphic_bliss()' (*note igraph_isomorphic_bliss --- Graph
isomorphism via BLISS::). This implementation only works for undirected
graphs.

   Finally, the isomorphism classes of all graphs with three and four
vertices are precomputed and stored in igraph, so for these small
graphs there is a very simple fast way to decide isomorphism.  See
`igraph_isomorphic_34()' (*note igraph_isomorphic_34 --- Graph
isomorphism for 3-4 vertices::).

------------------------------------------------------


     int igraph_permute_vertices(const igraph_t *graph, igraph_t *res,
     			    const igraph_vector_t *permutation);

   This function creates a new graph from the input graph by permuting
its vertices according to the specified mapping. Call this function
with the output of `igraph_canonical_permutation()' (*note
igraph_canonical_permutation --- Canonical permutation using BLISS::)
to create the canonical form of a graph.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     The input graph.

`res':
     Pointer to an uninitialized graph object. The new graph is created
     here.

`permutation':
     The permutation to apply. Vertex 0 is mapped to the first element
     of the vector, vertex 1 to the second, etc. Note that it is not
     checked that the vector contains every element only once, and no
     range checking is performed either.

   *Returns:. *

     Error code.

   Time complexity: O(|V|+|E|), linear in terms of the number of

12.1.2 igraph_isomorphic -- Decides whether two graphs are isomorphic
---------------------------------------------------------------------


     int igraph_isomorphic(const igraph_t *graph1, const igraph_t *graph2,
     		      igraph_bool_t *iso);

   From Wikipedia: The graph isomorphism problem or GI problem is the
graph theory problem of determining whether, given two graphs G1 and
G2, it is possible to permute (or relabel) the vertices of one graph so
that it is equal to the other. Such a permutation is called a graph
isomorphism.

   This function decides which graph isomorphism algorithm to be used
based on the input graphs. Right now it does the following:

  1. If one graph is directed and the other undirected then an error is
     triggered.

  2. If the two graphs does not have the same number of vertices and
     edges it returns with `FALSE'.

  3. Otherwise, if the graphs have three or four vertices then an O(1)
     algorithm is used with precomputed data.

  4. Otherwise, if the graphs are directed then VF2 is used, see
     `igraph_isomorphic_vf2()' (*note igraph_isomorphic_vf2 ---
     Isomorphism via VF2::).

  5. Otherwise BLISS is used, see `igraph_isomorphic_bliss()' (*note
     igraph_isomorphic_bliss --- Graph isomorphism via BLISS::).

   Please call the VF2 and BLISS functions directly if you need
something more sophisticated, e.g. you need the isomorphic mapping.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph1':
     The first graph.

`graph2':
     The second graph.

`iso':
     Pointer to a logical variable, will be set to TRUE (1) if the two
     graphs are isomorphic, and FALSE (0) otherwise.

   *Returns:. *

`'
     Error code.

12.2 The BLISS algorithm
========================

BLISS is a successor of the famous NAUTY algorithm and implementation.
While using the same ideas in general, with better heuristics and data
structure BLISS outperforms NAUTY on most graphs.

   BLISS was developed and implemented by Tommi Junttila and Petteri
Kaski at Helsinki University of Technology, Finland. See Tommi
Juntilla's homepage at http://www.tcs.hut.fi/~tjunttil/
(http://www.tcs.hut.fi/~tjunttil/) and the publication at
http://www.siam.org/proceedings/alenex/2007/alx07_013junttilat.pdf
(http://www.siam.org/proceedings/alenex/2007/alx07_013junttilat.pdf)
for more information.

   BLISS version 0.35 is included in igraph.

result is returned as part of the `info' structure, in tag
`group_size'. It is returned as a string, as it can be very high even
for relatively small graphs. If the GNU MP library is used then this

   For using it you need to define a calback function of type
`igraph_isohandler_t' (*note igraph_isohandler_t --- Callback type;
called when an isomorphism was found::). This function will be called
whenever VF2 finds an isomorphism between the two graphs. The mapping

`map12':
     Pointer to an initialized vector or `NULL'. If not `NULL' and the

     This is the same as `map12', but for the permutation taking
     `graph2' to `graph1'.

`function':
     The callback function to be called if an isomorphism is found. See

13.3.1 igraph_motifs_randesu -- Count the number of motifs in a graph
---------------------------------------------------------------------


     int igraph_motifs_randesu(const igraph_t *graph, igraph_vector_t *hist,
     			  int size, const igraph_vector_t *cut_prob);

   Motifs are small subgraphs of a given structure in a graph. It is
argued that the motif profile (ie. the number of different motifs in
the graph) is characteristic for different types of networks and
network function is related to the motifs in the graph.

   This function is able to find the different motifs of size three and
four (ie. the number of different subgraphs with three and four
vertices) in the network. (This limitation is the result of the lack of
code to decide graph isomorphism for larger graphs.)

   In a big network the total number of motifs can be very large, so it
takes a lot of time to find all of them, a sampling method can be used.
This function is capable of doing sampling via the `cut_prob' argument.
This argument gives the probability that a branch of the motif search
tree will not be explored. See S. Wernicke and F. Rasche: FANMOD: a
tool for fast network motif detection, Bioinformatics 22(9), 1152-1153,
2006 for details.

   Set the `cut_prob' argument to a zero vector for finding all motifs.

   Directed motifs will be counted in directed graphs and undirected
motifs in undirected graphs.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     The graph to find the motifs in.

`hist':
     The result of the computation, it gives the number of motifs found
     for each isomorphism class. See `igraph_isoclass()' (*note
     igraph_isoclass --- Determine the isomorphism class of a graph
     with 3 or 4 vertices::) for help about isomorphism classes.

`size':
     The size of the motifs to search for. Only three and four are
     implemented currently. The limitation is not in the motif finding
     code, but the graph isomorphism code.

`cut_prob':
     Vector of probabilities for cutting the search tree at a given
     level. The first element is the first level, etc.  Supply all
     zeros here (of length `size') to find all motifs in a graph.

   *Returns:. *

   This function counts the total number of motifs in a graph without
assigning isomorphism classes to them.

   Directed motifs will be counted in directed graphs and undirected
motifs in undirected graphs.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     The graph object to study.

`no':
     Pointer to an integer type, the result will be stored here.

     The size of the motifs to count.

     will be cut at a given level.

     				   igraph_integer_t sample_size,
     				   const igraph_vector_t *parsample);

   This function is useful for large graphs for which it is not
feasible to count all the different motifs, because there is very many
of them.

   The total number of motifs is estimated by taking a sample of
vertices and counts all motifs in which these vertices are included.
(There is also a `cut_prob' parameter which gives the probabilities to
cut a branch of the search tree.)

   Directed motifs will be counted in directed graphs and undirected
motifs in undirected graphs.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     The graph object to study.

`est':
     Pointer to an integer type, the result will be stored here.

`size':
     The size of the motif to look for.

`cut_prob':
     Vector giving the probabilities to cut a branch of the search tree
     and omit counting the motifs in that branch.  It contains a
     probability for each level. Supply `size' zeros here to count all
     the motifs in the sample.

`sample_size':
     The number of vertices to use as the sample. This parameter is
     only used if the `parsample' argument is a null pointer.

`parsample':
     Either pointer to an initialized vector or a null pointer. If a
     vector then the vertex ids in the vector are used as a sample. If
     a null pointer then the `sample_size' argument is used to create a
     sample of vertices drawn with uniform probability.

Layout generator functions (or at least most of them) try to place the
vertices and edges of a graph on a 2D plane or in 3D space in a way
which visually pleases the human eye.

return an `igraph_matrix_t', in which each row gives the coordinates of
a vertex.

   This is a port of the graphopt layout algorithm by Michael Schmuhl.
graphopt version 0.4.1 was rewritten in C and the support for layers
was removed (might be added later) and a code was a bit reorganized to
avoid some unneccessary steps is the node charge (see below) is zero.

   graphopt uses physical analogies for defining attracting and
repelling forces among the vertices and then the physical system is
simulated until it reaches an equilibrium. (There is no simulated
annealing or anything like that, so a stable fixed point is not
guaranteed.)

   See also http://www.schmuhl.org/graphopt/
(http://www.schmuhl.org/graphopt/) for the original graphopt.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     The input graph.

`res':
     Pointer to an initialized matrix, the result will be stored here
     and its initial contents is used the starting point of the
     simulation if the `use_seed' argument is true. Note that in this
     case the matrix should have the proper size, otherwise a warning
     is issued and the supplied values are ignored. If no starting
     positions are given (or they are invalid) then a random staring
     position is used.  The matrix will be resized if needed.

`niter':
     Integer constant, the number of iterations to perform.  Should be
     a couple of hundred in general. If you have a large graph then you
     might want to only do a few iterations and then check the result.
     If it is not good enough you can feed it in again in the `res'
     argument. The original graphopt default if 500.

`node_charge':
     The charge of the vertices, used to calculate electric repulsion.
     The original graphopt default is 0.001.

`node_mass':
     The mass of the vertices, used for the spring forces.  The
     original graphopt defaults to 30.

`spring_length':
     The length of the springs, an integer number.  The original
     graphopt defaults to zero.

`spring_constant':
     The spring constant, the original graphopt defaults to one.

`max_sa_movement':
     Real constant, it gives the maximum amount of movement allowed in
     a single step along a single axis. The original graphopt default
     is 5.

`use_seed':
     Logical scalar, whether to use the positions in `res' as a
     starting configuration. See also `res' above.

   *Returns:. *

`'
     Error code.

   Time complexity: O(n (|V|^2+|E|) ), n is the number of iterations,
|V| is the number of vertices, |E| the number of edges. If
`node_charge' is zero then it is only O(n|E|).

14.1.4 The DrL layout generator
-------------------------------

DrL is a sophisticated layout generator developed and implemented by
Shawn Martin et al., see
http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~smartin/software.html
(http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~smartin/software.html) for details. Only a
subset of the complete DrL functionality is included in igraph,
parallel runs and recursive, multi-level layouting is not supported.

   The parameters of the layout are stored in an
`igraph_layout_drl_options_t' (*note igraph_layout_drl_options_t ---
Parameters for the DrL layout generator::) structure, this can be
initialized by calling the function `igraph_layout_drl_options_init()'
(*note igraph_layout_drl_options_init --- Initialize parameters for the
DrL layout generator::).  The fields of this structure can then be
adjusted by hand if needed.  The layout is calculated by an
`igraph_layout_drl()' (*note igraph_layout_drl --- The DrL layout
generator::) call.

     layout step.

`maxdelta':
     The maximum length of the move allowed for a vertex in a single
     iteration.

`area':
     This parameter gives the area of the square on which the vertices
     will be placed.

`coolexp':
     The cooling exponent.

`repulserad':

     attraction of adjacenct vertices.

`cellsize':
     The size of the grid cells, one side of the square.

`proot':
     The root vertex, this is placed first, its neighbors in the first
     iteration, second neighbors in the second, etc. If negative then a
     random vertex is chosen.

still O(dia*maxit*(|V|^2+|E|)), this is the case when all vertices

15 Reading and Writing Graphs from and to Files
***********************************************

These functions can write a graph to a file, or read a graph from a
file.

   Note that as `igraph' uses the traditional C streams, it is possible
to read/write files from/to memory, at least on GNU operating systems
supporting `non-standard' streams.

     int igraph_read_graph_edgelist(igraph_t *graph, FILE *instream,
     			       igraph_integer_t n, igraph_bool_t directed);

   This format is simply a series of even number integers separated by
whitespace. The one edge (ie. two integers) per line format is thus not
required (but recommended for readability). Edges of directed graphs
are assumed to be in from, to order.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     Pointer to an uninitialized graph object.

`instream':
     Pointer to a stream, it should be readable.

`n':
     The number of vertices in the graph. If smaller than the largest
     integer in the file it will be ignored. It is thus safe to supply
     zero here.

`directed':
     Logical, if true the graph is directed, if false it will be
     undirected.

   *Returns:. *

     int igraph_write_graph_edgelist(const igraph_t *graph, FILE *outstream);

   One edge is written per line, separated by a single space.  For
directed graphs edges are written in from, to order.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     The graph object to write.

`outstream':
     Pointer to a stream, it should be writable.

   *Returns:. *

`'
     Error code: `IGRAPH_EFILE' if there is an error writing the file.

     			   igraph_strvector_t *predefnames,
     			   igraph_bool_t names, igraph_bool_t weights, igraph_bool_t directed);

   Also useful for creating graphs from `named' (and optionally
weighted) edge lists.

   This format is used by the Large Graph Layout program
(http://bioinformatics.icmb.utexas.edu/lgl/
(http://bioinformatics.icmb.utexas.edu/lgl/)), and it is simply a
symbolic weighted edge list. It is a simple text file with one edge per
line. An edge is defined by two symbolic vertex names separated by
whitespace. (The symbolic vertex names themselves cannot contain
whitespace. They might follow by an optional number, this will be the
weight of the edge; the number can be negative and can be in scientific
notation. If there is no weight specified to an edge it is assumed to
be zero.

   The resulting graph is always undirected.  LGL cannot deal with
files which contain multiple or loop edges, this is however not checked
here, as `igraph' is happy with these.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     Pointer to an uninitialized graph object.

`instream':
     Pointer to a stream, it should be readable.

`predefnames':
     Pointer to the symbolic names of the vertices in the file. If
     `NULL' is given here then vertex ids will be assigned to vertex
     names in the order of their appearence in the \c .ncol file. If it
     is not `NULL' and some unknown vertex names are found in the \c
     .ncol file then new vertex ids will be assigned to them.

`names':
     Logical value, if TRUE the symbolic names of the vertices will be
     added to the graph as a vertex attribute called `name'.

`weights':
     Logical value, if TRUE the weights of the edges is added to the
     graph as an edge attribute called `weight'.

`directed':
     Whether to create a directed graph. As this format was originally
     used only for undirected graphs there is no information in the
     file about the directedness of the graph.  Set this parameter to
     `IGRAPH_DIRECTED' or `IGRAPH_UNDIRECTED' to create a directed or
     undirected graph.

   *Returns:. *

`'
     Error code: `IGRAPH_PARSEERROR': if there is a problem reading the
     file, or the file is syntactically incorrect.

   Time complexity: O(|V|+|E|log(|V|)) if we neglect the time required
by the parsing. As usual |V| is the number of vertices, while |E| is
the number of edges.

for details.

   Note that having multiple or loop edges in an ` .ncol'  file breaks
the  LGL software but `igraph' does not check for this condition.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     The graph to write.

`outstream':
     The stream object to write to, it should be writable.

`names':
     The name of the vertex attribute, if symbolic names are written to
     the file. If not, supply 0 here.

`weights':
     The name of the edge attribute, if they are also written to the
     file. If you don't want weights, supply 0 here.

   *Returns:. *

---------------------------------------------------------------


     int igraph_read_graph_lgl(igraph_t *graph, FILE *instream,
     			  igraph_bool_t names, igraph_bool_t weights);

   The ` .lgl'  format is used by the Large Graph Layout visualization
software (http://bioinformatics.icmb.utexas.edu/lgl/
(http://bioinformatics.icmb.utexas.edu/lgl/)), it can describe
undirected optionally weighted graphs. From the LGL manual:

     The second format is the LGL file format (` .lgl'  file suffix).
     This is yet another graph file format that tries to be as stingy
     as possible with space, yet keeping the edge file in a human
     readable (not binary) format. The format itself is like the
     following:

           # vertex1name
          vertex2name [optionalWeight]
          vertex3name [optionalWeight]

     Here, the first vertex of an edge is preceded with a pound sign
     '#'.  Then each vertex that shares an edge with that vertex is
     listed one per line on subsequent lines.

   LGL cannot handle loop and multiple edges or directed graphs, but in
`igraph' it is not an error to have multiple and loop edges.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     Pointer to an uninitialized graph object.

`instream':
     A stream, it should be readable.

`names':
     Logical value, if TRUE the symbolic names of the vertices will be
     added to the graph as a vertex attribute called `name'.

`weights':
     Logical value, if TRUE the weights of the edges is added to the
     graph as an edge attribute called `weight'.

   *Returns:. *

`'
     Error code: `IGRAPH_PARSEERROR': if there is a problem reading the
     file, or the file is syntactically incorrect.

   Time complexity: O(|V|+|E|log(|V|)) if we neglect the time required

the number of edges.

   This function reads the DIMACS file format, more specifically the
version for network flow problems, see the files at
ftp://dimacs.rutgers.edu/pub/netflow/general-info/

   This is a line-oriented text file (ASCII) format. The first
character of each line defines the type of the line. If the first
character is ` c'  the line is a comment line and it is ignored. There
is one problem line (` p'  in the file, it must appear before any node
and arc descriptor lines. The problem line has three fields separated
by spaces: the problem type (` min' , ` max'  or ` asn' ), the number
of vertices and number of edges in the graph.  Exactly two node
identification lines are expected (` n' ), one for the source, one for
the target vertex.  These have two fields: the id of the vertex and the
type of the vertex, either ` s'  (=source) or ` t' (=target). Arc lines
start with ` a'  and have three fields: the source vertex, the target
vertex and the edge capacity.

   Vertex ids are numbered from 1.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     Pointer to an uninitialized graph object.

`instream':
     The file to read from.

`source':
     Pointer to an integer, the id of the source node will be stored
     here. (The igraph vertex id, which is one less than the actual
     number in the file.) It is ignored if ` NULL' .

`target':
     Pointer to an integer, the (igraph) id of the target node will be
     stored here. It is ignored if ` NULL' .

`capacity':
     Pointer to an initialized vector, the capacity of the edges will
     be stored here if not ` NULL' .

`directed':
     Boolean, whether to create a directed graph.

   *Returns:. *

     The graphs are stored in a compact binary format, one graph per
     file. The file is composed of 16 bit words, which are represented
     using the so-called little-endian convention, i.e. the least
     significant byte of the word is stored first.

     Then, for each node, the file contains the list of edges coming
     out of the node itself. The list is represented by a word encoding
     its length, followed by a word for each edge, representing the
     destination node of the edge. Node numeration is 0-based, so the
     first node of the graph has index 0.

   Only unlabelled graphs are implemented.

implemented in igraph: it can read GraphML files without nested graphs
and hyperedges.  Attributes of the graph are loaded only if an
attribute interface is attached, ie. if you use igraph from R or Python.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     Pointer to an uninitialized graph object.

`instream':
     A stream, it should be readable.

`index':
     If the GraphML file contains more than one graph, the one
     specified by this index will be loaded. Indices start from zero,
     so supply zero here if your GraphML file contains only a single
     graph.

   *Returns:. *

`'
     Error code: `IGRAPH_PARSEERROR': if there is a problem reading the
     file, or the file is syntactically incorrect.
     `IGRAPH_UNIMPLEMENTED': the GraphML functionality was disabled at
     compile-time

   GML is a simple textual format, see
http://www.infosun.fim.uni-passau.de/Graphlet/GML/
(http://www.infosun.fim.uni-passau.de/Graphlet/GML/) for details.

   Although all syntactically correct GML can be parsed, we implement
only a subset of this format, some attributes might be ignored. Here is
a list of all the differences:

  1. Only ` node'  and ` edge'  attributes are used, and only if they
     have a simple type: integer, real or string. So if an attribute is
     an array or a record, then it is ignored. This is also true if
     only some values of the attribute are complex.

  2. Top level attributes except for ` Version'  and the first ` graph'
     attribute are completely ignored.

  3. Graph attributes except for ` node'  and ` edge'  are completely
     ignored.

  4. There is no maximum line length.

  5. There is no maximum keyword length.

  6. Character entities in strings are not interpreted.

  7. We allow ` inf'  (infinity) and ` nan' (not a number) as a real
     number. This is case insensitive, so ` nan' , ` NaN'  and ` NAN'
     are equal.

   Please contact us if you cannot live with these limitations of the
GML parser.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     Pointer to an uninitialized graph object.

`instream':
     The stream to read the GML file from.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


     int igraph_write_graph_gml(const igraph_t *graph, FILE *outstream,
     			   const igraph_vector_t *id, const char *creator);

   GML is a quite general textual format, see
http://www.infosun.fim.uni-passau.de/Graphlet/GML/
(http://www.infosun.fim.uni-passau.de/Graphlet/GML/) for details.

   The graph, vertex and edges attributes are written to the file as
well, if they are numeric of string.

   As igraph is more forgiving about attribute names, it might be
neccessary to simplify the them before writing to the GML file.  This
way we'll have a syntactically correct GML file. The following simple
procedure is performed on each attribute name: first the alphanumeric
characters are extracted, the others are ignored. Then if the first
character is not a letter then the attribute name is prefixed with
`igraph'.  Note that this might result identical names for two
attributes, igraph does not check this.

   The `id' vertex attribute is treated specially.  If the `id'
argument is not 0 then it should be a numeric vector with the vertex
ids and the `id' vertex attribute is ignored (if there is one). If `id'
is 0 and there is a numeric `id' vertex attribute that is used instead.
If ids are not specified in either way then the regular igraph vertex
ids are used.

   Note that whichever way vertex ids are specified, their uniqueness
is not checked.

   If the graph has edge attributes named `source' or `target' they're
silently ignored. GML uses these attributes to specify the edges, so we
cannot write them to the file. Rename them before calling this function
if you want to preserve them.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     The graph to write to the stream.

`outstream':
     The stream to write the file to.

`id':
     Either ` NULL'  or a numeric vector with the vertex ids.  See
     details above.

`creator':
     An optional string to write to the stream in the creator line.  If
     this is 0 then the current date and time is added.

   *Returns:. *

   *Returns:. *

     Error code.

   Only a subset of the Pajek format is implemented. This is partially
because this format is not very well documented, but also because
`igraph' does not support some Pajek features, like multigraphs.

   The list of the current limitations:

  1. Only `.net' files are supported, Pajek project files (`.paj') are
     not. These might be supported in the future if there is need for
     it.

  2. Time events networks are not supported.

  3. Hypergraphs (ie. graphs with non-binary edges) are not supported.

  4. Graphs with both directed and non-directed edges are not
     supported, are they cannot be represented in `igraph'.

  5. Bipartite or affiliation networks are not supported. They can be
     imported but the vertex type information is omitted.

  6. Only Pajek networks are supported, permutations, hierarchies,
     clusters and vectors are not.

  7. Graphs with multiple edge sets are not supported.

   If there are attribute handlers installed, `igraph' also reads the
vertex and edge attributes from the file. Most attributes are renamed
to be more informative: ``color'' instead of ``c'', ``xfact'' instead
of ``x_fact'', ``yfact'' instead of `y_fact', ``labeldist'' instead of
``lr'', ``labeldegree2'' instead of ``lphi'', ``framewidth'' instead of
``bw'', ``fontsize'' instead of ``fos'', ``rotation'' instead of
``phi'', ``radius'' instead of ``r'', ``diamondratio'' instead of
``q'', ``labeldegree'' instead of ``la'', ``vertexsize'' instead of
``size'', ``color'' instead of ``ic'', ``framecolor'' instead of
``bc'', ``labelcolor'' instead of ``lc'', these belong to vertices.

   Edge attributes are also renamed, ``s'' to ``arrowsize'', ``w'' to
``edgewidth'', ``h1'' to ``hook1'', ``h2'' to ``hook2'', ``a1'' to
``angle1'', ``a2'' to ``angle2'', ``k1'' to ``velocity1'', ``k2'' to
``velocity2'', ``ap'' to ``arrowpos'', ``lp'' to ``labelpos'', ``lr'' to
``labelangle'', ``lphi'' to ``labelangle2'', ``la'' to ``labeldegree'',
``fos'' to ``fontsize'', ``a'' to ``arrowtype'', ``p'' to
``linepattern'', ``l'' to ``label'', ``lc'' to ``labelcolor'', ``c'' to
``color''.

   In addition the following vertex attributes might be added: ``id''
if there are vertex ids in the file, ``x'' and ``y'' or ``x'' and ``y''
and ``z'' if there are vertex coordinates in the file, ``color-red'',
``color-green'' and ``color-blue'' if the vertex color is given in RGB
notation, ``framecolor-red'', ``framecolor-green'' and
``framecolor-blue'` if the frame color is given in RGB notation and
finally ``labelcolor-red'', ``labelcolor-green'' and
``labelcolor-blue'' if the label color is given in RGB notation.

   The following additional edge attributes might be added: ``weight''
if there are edge weights present, ``color-red'', ``color-green'' and
``color-blue'' if the edge color is given in RGB notation.

16.1.1 igraph_maxflow_value -- Maximum flow in a network with the push/relabel algorithm
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


     int igraph_maxflow_value(const igraph_t *graph, igraph_real_t *value,
     			 igraph_integer_t source, igraph_integer_t target,
     			 const igraph_vector_t *capacity);

   This function implements the Goldberg-Tarjan algorithm for
calculating value of the maximum flow in a directed or undirected
graph. The algorithm was given in Andrew V. Goldberg, Robert E. Tarjan:
A New Approach to the Maximum-Flow Problem, Journal of the ACM, 35(4),
921-940, 1988.

   The input of the function is a graph, a vector of real numbers
giving the capacity of the edges and two vertices of the graph, the
source and the target. A flow is a function assigning positive real
numbers to the edges and satisfying two requirements: (1) the flow
value is less than the capacity of the edge and (2) at each vertex
except the source and the target, the incoming flow (ie. the sum of the
flow on the incoming edges) is the same as the outgoing flow (ie. the
sum of the flow on the outgoing edges). The value of the flow is the
incoming flow at the target vertex. The maximum flow is the flow with
the maximum value.

   This function can only calculate the value of the maximum flow, but
not the flow itself (may be added later).

   According to a theorem by Ford and Furkelson (L. R. Ford Jr. and D.
R. Fulkerson. Maximal flow through a network. Canadian J. Math.,
8:399-404, 1956.) the maximum flow between two vertices is the same as
the minimum cut between them (also called the minimum s-t cut). So
`igraph_st_mincut_value()' (*note igraph_st_mincut_value --- The
minimum s-t cut in a graph::) gives the same result in all cases as
`igraph_maxflow_value'().

   Note that the value of the maximum flow is the same as the minimum
cut in the graph.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     The input graph, either directed or undirected.

`value':
     Pointer to a real number, the result will be placed here.

`source':
     The id of the source vertex.

`target':
     The id of the target vertex.

`capacity':
     Vector containing the capacity of the edges. If NULL, then every
     edge is considered to have capacity 1.0.

   *Returns:. *

`'
     Error code.

   Time complexity: O(|V|^3). In practice it is much faster, but i
cannot prove a better lower bound for the data structure i've used. In
fact, this implementation runs much faster than the `hi_pr'
implementation discussed in B. V. Cherkassky and A. V. Goldberg: On
implementing the push-relabel method for the maximum flow problem,
(Algorithmica, 19:390-410, 1997) on all the graph classes i've tried.

     			   igraph_integer_t source, igraph_integer_t target,
     			   const igraph_vector_t *capacity);

   The minimum s-t cut in a weighted (=valued) graph is the total
minimum edge weight needed to remove from the graph to eliminate all
paths from a given vertex (`source') to another vertex (`target').
Directed paths are considered in directed graphs, and undirected paths
in undirected graphs.

   The minimum s-t cut between two vertices is known to be same as the
maximum flow between these two vertices. So this function calls
`igraph_maxflow_value()' (*note igraph_maxflow_value --- Maximum flow
in a network with the push/relabel algorithm::) to do the calculation.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     The input graph.

`source':
     The id of the source vertex.

     numbers and its length should be the same the the number of edges
     in the graph. It can be a null pointer, then every edge has unit
     capacity.

-------------------------------------------------------------


     int igraph_mincut_value(const igraph_t *graph, igraph_real_t *res,
     			const igraph_vector_t *capacity);

   The minimum edge cut in a graph is the total minimum weight of the
edges needed to remove from the graph to make the graph _not_ strongly
connected. (If the original graph is not strongly connected then this
is zero.) Note that in undirected graphs strong connectedness is the
same as weak connectedness.

   The minimum cut can be calculated with maximum flow techniques,
although the current implementation does this only for directed graphs
and a separate non-flow based implementation is used for undirected
graphs. See Mechthild Stoer and Frank Wagner: A simple min-cut
algorithm, Journal of the ACM 44 585-591, 1997.  For directed graphs
the maximum flow is calculated between a fixed vertex and all the other
vertices in the graph and this is done in both directions. Then the
minimum is taken to get the minimum cut.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     The input graph.

`res':
     Pointer to a real variable, the result will be stored here.

`capacity':
     Pointer to the capacity vector, it should contain the same number
     of non-negative numbers as the number of edges in the graph. If a
     null pointer then all edges will have unit capacity.

     		  igraph_vector_t *partition2,
     		  igraph_vector_t *cut,
     		  const igraph_vector_t *capacity);

   This function calculates the minimum cut in a graph. Right now it is
implemented only for undirected graphs, in which case it uses the
Stoer-Wagner algorithm, as described in M. Stoer and F. Wagner: A
simple min-cut algorithm, Journal of the ACM, 44 585-591, 1997.

   The minimum cut is the mimimum set of edges which needs to be
removed to disconnect the graph. The minimum is calculated using the
weigths (`capacity') of the edges, so the cut with the minimum total
capacity is calculated.

   The first implementation of the actual cut calculation was made by
Gregory Benison, thanks Greg.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     The input graph.

`value':
     Pointer to an integer, the value of the cut will be stored here.

`partition':
     Pointer to an initialized vector, the ids of the vertices in the
     first partition after separating the graph will be stored here.
     The vector will be resized as needed. This argument is ignored if
     it is a NULL pointer.

`partition2':
     Pointer to an initialized vector the ids of the vertices in the
     second partition will be stored here.  The vector will be resized
     as needed. This argument is ignored if it is a NULL pointer.

`cut':
     Pointer to an initialized vector, the ids of the edges in the cut
     will be stored here. This argument is ignored if it is a NULL
     pointer.

17.1.1 igraph_modularity -- Calculate the modularity of a graph with respect to some vertex types
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


     int igraph_modularity(const igraph_t *graph,
     		      const igraph_vector_t *membership,
     		      igraph_real_t *modularity,
     			  const igraph_vector_t *weights);

   The modularity of a graph with respect to some division (or vertex
types) measures how good the division is, or how separated are the
different vertex types from each other. It defined as Q=1/(2m) *
sum(Aij-ki*kj/(2m)delta(ci,cj),i,j), here `m' is the number of edges,
`Aij' is the element of the `A' adjacency matrix in row `i' and column
`j', `ki' is the degree of `i', `kj' is the degree of `j', `ci' is the
type (or component) of `i', `cj' that of `j', the sum goes over all `i'
and `j' pairs of vertices, and `delta(x,y)' is one if x=y and zero
otherwise.

   Modularity on weighted graphs is also meaningful. When taking edge
weights into account, `Aij' becomes the weight of the corresponding
edge (or 0 if there is no edge), `ki' is the total weight of edges
adjacent to vertex `i', `kj' is the total weight of edges adjacent to
vertex `j' and `m' is the total weight of all edges.

   See also MEJ Newman and M Girvan: Finding and evaluating community
structure in networks. Physical Review E 69 026113, 2004.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     The input graph.

`membership':
     Numeric vector which gives the type of each vertex, ie. the
     component to which it belongs.

`modularity':
     Pointer to a real number, the result will be stored here.

`weights':
     Weight vector or NULL if no weights are specified.

   This function creates a membership vector from a community structure
dendrogram. A membership vector contains for each vertex the id of its
graph component, the graph components are numbered from zero, see the
same argument of `igraph_clusters()' (*note igraph_clusters ---
Calculates the [weakly or strongly] connected components in a graph_::)

function is the implementation of the Walktrap community::) an
`igraph_community_edge_betweenness()' (*note
igraph_community_edge_betweenness --- Community findinf based on edge
betweenness::) are two examples. The matrix contains the merge
operations performed while mapping the hierarchical structure of a
network. If the matrix has `n-1' rows, where `n' is the number of
vertices in the graph, then it contains the hierarchical structure of
the whole network and it is called a dendrogram.

   This function performs `steps' merge operations as prescribed by the
`merges' matrix and returns the current state of the network.

   If if `merges' is not a complete dendrogram, it is possible to take
`steps' steps if `steps' is not bigger than the number lines in
`merges'.

   *Arguments:. *

`merges':
     The two-column matrix containing the merge operations. See
     `igraph_community_walktrap()' (*note igraph_community_walktrap ---
     This function is the implementation of the Walktrap community::)
     for the detailed syntax.

`nodes':
     The number of leaf nodes in the dendrogram

`steps':
     Integer constant, the number of steps to take.

`membership':
     Pointer to an initialied vector, the membership results will be
     stored here, if not NULL. The vector will be resized as needed.

`csize':
     Pointer to an initialized vector, or NULL. If not NULL then the

     positive, altough this is not tested.

`modularity':
     Pointer to a real number, if not `NULL' then the modularity score
     of the solution will be stored here, see M. E. J. Newman and M.
     Girvan, Phys. Rev. E 69, 026113 (2004) for details.

`temperature':
     Pointer to a real number, if not `NULL' then the temperature at
     the end of the algorithm will be stored here.

`membership':
     Pointer to an initialized vector or `NULL'. If not `NULL' then the
     result of the clustering will be stored here, for each vertex the
     number of its cluster is given, the first cluster is numbered
     zero. The vector will be resized as needed.

`csize':
     Pointer to an initialized vector or `NULL'. If not `NULL' then the
     sizes of the clusters will stored here in cluster number order.
     The vector will be resized as needed.

`spins':
     Integer giving the number of spins, ie. the maximum number of
     clusters. Usually it is not a program to give a high number here,
     the default was 25 in the original code. Even if the number of
     spins is high the number of clusters in the result might small.

`parupdate':
     A logical constant, whether to update all spins in parallel. The
     default for this argument was `FALSE' (ie. 0) in the original code.

`starttemp':
     Real number, the temperature at the start. The value of this
     argument was 1.0 in the original code.

`stoptemp':
     Real number, the algorithm stops at this temperature. The default
     was 0.01 in the original code.

`coolfact':
     Real number, the coolinf factor for the simulated annealing. The
     default was 0.99 in the original code.

`update_rule':
     The type of the update rule. Possible values:
     `IGRAPH_SPINCOMM_UPDATE_SIMPLE' and
     `IGRAPH_SPINCOMM_UPDATE_CONFIG'. Basically this parameter defined
     the null model based on which the actual clustering is done. If
     this is `IGRAPH_SPINCOMM_UPDATE_SIMPLE' then the random graph (ie.
     G(n,p)), if it is `IGRAPH_SPINCOMM_UPDATE' then the configuration
     model is used. The configuration means that the baseline for the
     clustering is a random graph with the same degree distribution as
     the input graph.

`gamma':
     Real number. The gamma parameter of the algorithm. This defined
     the weight of the missing and existing links in the quality
     function for the clustering. The default value in the original
     code was 1.0, which is equal weight to missing and existing edges.
     Smaller values make the existing links contibute more to the
     energy function which is minimized in the algorithm. Bigger values
     make the missing links more important. (If my understanding is
     correct.)

17.3 Community structure based on eigenvectors of matrices
==========================================================

The functions documented in these section implement the `leading
eigenvector' method developed by Mark Newman and published in MEJ
Newman: Finding community structure using the eigenvectors of matrices,
arXiv:physics/0605087. TODO: proper citation.

   The heart of the method is the definition of the modularity matrix,
B, which is B=A-P, A being the adjacency matrix of the (undirected)
network, and P contains the probability that certain edges are present
according to the `configuration model' In other words, a Pij element of
P is the probability that there is an edge between vertices i and j in
a random network in which the degrees of all vertices are the same as
in the input graph.

   The leading eigenvector method works by calculating the eigenvector
of the modularity matrix for the largest positive eigenvalue and then
separating vertices into two community based on the sign of the
corresponding element in the eigenvector. If all elements in the
eigenvector are of the same sign that means that the network has no
underlying comuunity structure.  Check Newman's paper to understand why
this is a good method for detecting community structure.

   Three function are implemented, they all work accoding to the same
principles. The simplest is perhaps
`igraph_community_leading_eigenvector_naive()' (*note
igraph_community_leading_eigenvector_naive --- Leading eigenvector
community finding [naive version]_::). This function splits the network
as described above and then recursively splits the two components after
the split as individual networks, if possible.  This however is not a
good way for maximizing moduilarity, again see the paper for
explanation and the proper definition of modularity.

   The correct recursive community structure detection method is
implemented in `igraph_community_leading_eigenvector()' (*note
igraph_community_leading_eigenvector --- Leading eigenvector community
finding [proper version]_::).  Here, after the initial split, the
following splits are done in a way to optimize modularity regarding the
original network.  I can't say it enough, see the paper, particularly
section VI.

   The third function is `igraph_community_leading_eigenvector_step()'
(*note igraph_community_leading_eigenvector_step --- Leading
eigenvector community finding [make one step]_::), this starts from a
division of the network and tries to split a given community into two
subcommunities via the same (correct) method as
`igraph_community_leading_eigenvector()' (*note
igraph_community_leading_eigenvector --- Leading eigenvector community
finding [proper version]_::).

     					 igraph_integer_t steps,
     					 igraph_arpack_options_t *options);

   Newman's leading eigenvector method for detecting community
structure. This is the proper implementation of the recursive, divisive
algorithm: each split is done by maximizing the modularity regarding
the original network, see MEJ Newman: Finding community structure in
networks using the eigenvectors of matrices, arXiv:physics/0605087.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     The undirected input graph.

`merges':
     The result of the algorithm, a matrix containing the information
     about the splits performed. The matrix is built in the opposite
     way however, it is like the result of an agglomerative algorithm.
     If at the end of the algorithm (after `steps' steps was done)
     there are `p' communities, then these are numbered from zero to
     `p-1'. The first line of the matrix contains the first `merge'
     (which is in reality the last split) of two communities into
     community `p', the merge in the second line forms community `p+1',
     etc. The matrix should be initialized before calling and will be
     resized as needed.  This argument is ignored of it is `NULL'.

`membership':
     The membership of the vertices after all the splits were performed
     will be stored here. The vector must be initialized  before
     calling and will be resized as needed.  This argument is ignored
     if it is `NULL'.

`steps':
     The maximum number of steps to perform. It might happen that some
     component (or the whole network) has no underlying community
     structure and no further steps can be done. If you wany as many
     steps as possible then supply the number of vertices in the
     network here.

`options':
     The options for ARPACK. `n' is always overwritten. `ncv' is set to
     at least 3.

   *Returns:. *

     statistical mechanics::) for other community structure detection
     methods.

   A naive implementation of Newman's eigenvector community structure
detection. This function splits the network into two components
according to the leading eigenvector of the modularity matrix and then
recursively takes `steps' steps by splitting the components as

Newman: Finding community structure in networks using the eigenvectors
of matrices, arXiv:physics/0605087. Consider using the correct
`igraph_community_leading_eigenvector()' (*note

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     The input graph, should be undirected to make sense.

     The membership vector, for each vertex it gives the id of its
     community after all the splits are performed.  This argument is
     ignored if it is `NULL'.

     The number of splits to do, if possible. Supply the number of
     vertices in the network here to perform as many steps as possible.

   Do one split according to Mark Newman's leading eigenvector
community detection method. See MEJ Newman: Finding community structure

for the details.

   Use this function instead of
`igraph_community_leading_eigenvector()' (*note

this function.

   *Arguments:. *

   Note that the graph must not contain isolated vertices in order to

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     The input graph.

`weights':
     Numeric vector giving the weights of the edges.  If it is a NULL

`steps':
     Integer constant, the length of the random walks.

`merges':
     Pointer to a matrix, the merges performed by the algorithm will be

     matrix and contains the ids of the merged clusters. Clusters are
     numbered from zero and cluster number smaller than the number of
     nodes in the network belong to the individual vertices as
     singleton clusters. In each step a new cluster is created from two
     other clusters and its id will be one larger than the largest
     cluster id so far. This means that before the first merge we have
     `n' clusters (the number of vertices in the graph) numbered from
     zero to `n-1'. The first merge created cluster `n', the second
     cluster `n'+1, etc.

`modularity':

     current clustering is stored here after each merge operation.

   Community structure detection based on the betweenness of the edges
in the network. The algorithm was invented by M. Girvan and M. Newman,
see: M. Girvan and M. E. J. Newman: Community structure in social and
biological networks, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 99, 7821-7826 (2002).

   The idea is that the betweenness of the edges connecting two
communities is typically high, as many of the shortest paths between
nodes in separate communities go through them. So we gradually remove
the edge with highest betweenness from the network, and recalculate
edge betweenness after every removal.  This way sooner or later the
network falls off to two components, then after a while one of these
components falls off to two smaller components, etc. until all edges
are removed. This is a divisive hieararchical approach, the result is a
dendrogram.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     The input graph.

`result':
     Pointer to an initialized vector, the result will be stored here,
     the ids of the removed edges in the order of their removal. It
     will be resized as needed.

`edge_betweenness':
     Pointer to an initialized vector or NULL. In the former case the
     edge betweenness of the removed edge is stored here. The vector
     will be resized as needed.

`merges':
     Pointer to an initialized matrix or NULL. If not NULL then merges
     performed by the algorithm are stored here. Even if this is a
     divisive algorithm, we can replay it backwards and note which two
     clusters were merged. Clusters are numbered from zero, see the

     edge removals which separated the network into more components are
     marked here.

`directed':

     directed paths) for directed graphs. It is ignored for undirected

     				   igraph_matrix_t *res,
     				   igraph_vector_t *bridges);

   This function is handy if you have a sequence of edge which are
gradually removed from the network and you would like to know how the
network falls apart into separate components. The edge sequence may
come from the `igraph_community_edge_betweenness()' (*note
igraph_community_edge_betweenness --- Community findinf based on edge
betweenness::) function, but this is not neccessary. Note that
`igraph_community_edge_betweenness' (*note
igraph_community_edge_betweenness --- Community findinf based on edge
betweenness::) can also calculate the dendrogram, via its `merges'
argument.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     The input graph.

`edges':
     Vector containing the edges to be removed from the network, all
     edges are expected to appear exactly once in the vector.

`res':
     Pointer to an initialized matrix, if not NULL then the dendrogram
     will be stored here, in the same form as for the
     `igraph_community_walktrap()' (*note igraph_community_walktrap ---
     This function is the implementation of the Walktrap community::)
     function: the matrix has two columns and each line is a merge
     given by the ids of the merged components. The component ids are
     number from zero and component ids smaller than the number of
     vertices in the graph belong to individual vertices. The
     non-trivial components containing at least two vertices are
     numbered from `n', `n' is the number of vertices in the graph. So
     if the first line contains `a' and `b' that means that components
     `a' and `b' are merged into component `n', the second line creates
     component `n'+1, etc. The matrix will be resized as needed.

`bridges':
     Pointer to an initialized vector or NULL. If not null then the
     index of the edge removals which split the network will be stored
     here. The vector will be resized as needed.

19.1 About the ARPACK interface in igraph
=========================================

ARPACK is a library for solving large scale eigenvalue problems.  The
package is designed to compute a few eigenvalues and corresponding
eigenvectors of a general `n' by `n' matrix `A'. It is most appropriate
for large sparse or structured matrices `A' where structured means that
a matrix-vector product ` w <- Av'  requires order `n' rather than the
usual order ` n^2'  floating point operations. Please see
http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/
(http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/) for details.

   The eigenvalue calculation in ARPACK (in the simplest case) involves
the calculation of the `Av' product where `A' is the matrix we work
with and `v' is an arbitrary vector. A user-defined function of type
`igraph_arpack_function_t' (*note igraph_arpack_function_t --- Type of
the ARPACK callback function::) is expected to perform this product. If
the product can be done efficiently, e.g. if the matrix is sparse, then
ARPACK is usually able to calculate the eigenvalues very quickly.

   In igraph, eigenvalue/eigenvector calculations usually involve the
following steps:

  1. Initialization of an `igraph_arpack_options_t' (*note
     igraph_arpack_options_t --- Options for ARPACK::) data structure
     using `igraph_arpack_options_init' (*note
     igraph_arpack_options_init --- Initialize ARPACK options::).

  2. Setting some options in the initialized `igraph_arpack_options_t'
     (*note igraph_arpack_options_t --- Options for ARPACK::) object.

  3. Defining a function of type `igraph_arpack_function_t' (*note
     igraph_arpack_function_t --- Type of the ARPACK callback
     function::).  The input of this function is a vector, and the
     output should be the output matrix multiplied by the input vector.

  4. Calling `igraph_arpack_rssolve()' (*note igraph_arpack_rssolve ---
     ARPACK solver for symmetric matrices::) (is the matrix is
     symmetric), or `igraph_arpack_rnsolve()' (*note
     igraph_arpack_rnsolve --- ARPACK solver for non-symmetric
     matrices::).

The `igraph_arpack_options_t' (*note igraph_arpack_options_t ---
Options for ARPACK::) object can be used multiple times.

   If we have many eigenvalue problems to solve, then it might worth to
create an `igraph_arpack_storage_t' (*note igraph_arpack_storage_t ---
Storage for ARPACK::) object, and initialize it via
`igraph_arpack_storage_init()' (*note igraph_arpack_storage_init ---
Initialize ARPACK storage::). This structure contains all memory needed
for ARPACK (with the given upper limit regerding to the size of the
eigenvalue problem). Then many problems can be solved using the same
`igraph_arpack_storage_t' (*note igraph_arpack_storage_t --- Storage
for ARPACK::) object, without always reallocating the required memory.
The `igraph_arpack_storage_t' (*note igraph_arpack_storage_t ---
Storage for ARPACK::) object needs to be destroyed by calling
`igraph_arpack_storage_destroy()' (*note igraph_arpack_storage_destroy
--- Deallocate ARPACK storage::) on it, when it is not needed any more.

   igraph does not contain all ARPACK routines, only the ones dealing
with symmetric and non-symmetric eigenvalue problems using double

   This data structure contains the options of thee ARPACK eigenvalue
solver routines. It must be initialized by calling
`igraph_arpack_options_init()' (*note igraph_arpack_options_init ---

ARPACK calls, as the ARPACK solvers do not modify it.  Input options:

   *Values:. *

`bmat':
     Character. Whether to solve a standard ('I') ot a generalized
     problem ('B').

`n':
     Dimension of the eigenproblem.

`tol':
     Stopping criterion: the relative accuracy of the Ritz value is

     used.

`ncv':
     Number of Lanczos vectors to be generated.

`ldv':
     Numberic scalar. It should be set to zero in the current igraph
     implementation.

`ishift':
     Either zero or one. If zero then the shifts are provided by the
     user via reverse communication. If one then exact shifts with
     respect to the reduced tridiagonal matrix `T'.  Please always set
     this to one.

     Maximum number of Arnoldi update iterations allowed.

`nb':
     Blocksize to be used in the recurrence. Please always leave this
     on the default value, one.

`mode':
     The type of the eigenproblem to be solved.  Possible values if the
     input matrix is symmetric:

       1. A*x=lambda*x, A is symmetric.

       2. A*x=lambda*M*x, A is symmetric, M is symmetric positive
          definite.

       3. K*x=lambda*M*x, K is symmetric, M is symmetric positive
          semi-definite.

          symmetric indefinite.

       5. A*x=lambda*M*x, A is symmetric, M is symmetric positive
          semi-definite. (Cayley transformed mode.)

     not work properly.  Possible values if the input matrix is not
     symmetric:

       1. A*x=lambda*x.

       2. A*x=lambda*M*x, M is symmetric positive definite.

       3. A*x=lambda*M*x, M is symmetric semi-definite.

     Please note that only `mode' == 1 was tested and other values
     might not work properly.

`start':
     Whether to use the supplied starting vector (1), or use a random
     starting vector (0). The starting vector must be supplied in the
     first column of the `vectors' argument of the
     `igraph_arpack_rssolve()' (*note igraph_arpack_rssolve --- ARPACK
     solver for symmetric matrices::) of `igraph_arpack_rnsolve()'

          Maximum number of iterations taken.

    `3 '
          No shifts could be applied during a cycle of the Implicitly
          restarted Arnoldi iteration. One possibility is to increase
          the size of \ ncv relative to `nev'.

     ARPACK can return other error flags as well, but these are
     converted to igraph errors, see `igraph_error_type_t' (*note
     igraph_error_type_t --- Error code type_::).

`ierr':
     Error flag of the second ARPACK call (one eigenvalue computation
     usually involves two calls to ARPACK). This is always zero, as
     other error codes are converted to igraph errors.

`noiter':
     Number of Arnoldi iterations taken.

`nconv':
     Number of converged Ritz values. This represents the number of
     Ritz values that satisfy the convergence critetion.

`numop':
     Total number of matrix-vector multiplications.

`numopb':
     Not used currently.

`numreo':

igraph_arpack_options_t --- Options for ARPACK::) object to built-in
igraph functions without any modification. The built-in igraph

     Pointer to an `igraph_arpack_function_t' (*note

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


     int igraph_arpack_unpack_complex(igraph_matrix_t *vectors, igraph_matrix_t *values,
     				 long int nev);

   This function works on the output of `igraph_arpack_rnsolve' (*note
igraph_arpack_rnsolve --- ARPACK solver for non-symmetric matrices::)
and brushes it up a bit: it only keeps `nev' eigenvalues/vectors and
every eigenvector is stored in two columns of the `vectors' matrix.

   The output of the non-symmetric ARPACK solver is somewhat hard to
parse, as real eigenvectors occupy only one column in the matrix, and
the complex conjugate eigenvectors are not stored at all (usually). The
other problem is that the solver might return more eigenvalues than
requested. The common use of this function is to call it directly after
`igraph_arpack_rnsolve' (*note igraph_arpack_rnsolve --- ARPACK solver
for non-symmetric matrices::) with its `vectors' and `values' argument
and `options'->nev as `nev'.

   *Arguments:. *

`vectors':
     The eigenvector matrix, as returned by `igraph_arpack_rnsolve'
     (*note igraph_arpack_rnsolve --- ARPACK solver for non-symmetric
     matrices::). It will be resized, typically it will be larger.

`values':
     The eigenvalue matrix, as returned by `igraph_arpack_rnsolve'
     (*note igraph_arpack_rnsolve --- ARPACK solver for non-symmetric
     matrices::). It will be resized, typically extra, unneeded rows
     (=eigenvalues) will be removed.

`nev':
     The number of eigenvalues/vectors to keep. Can be less or equal
     than the number originally requested from ARPACK.

   *Returns:. *

`'
     Error code.

   Time complexity: linear in the number of elements in the `vectors'
matrix.

20.1 Bipartite networks in igraph
=================================

A bipartite network contains two kinds of vertices and connections are
only possible between two vertices of different kind. There are many
natural examples, e.g. movies and actors as vertices and a movie is
connected to all participating actors, etc.

   igraph does not have direct support for bipartite networks, at least
not at the C language level. In other words the igraph_t structure does
not contain information about the vertex types.  The C functions for
bipartite networks usually have an additional input argument to graph,
called `types', a boolean vector giving the vertex types.

   Most functions creating bipartite networks are able to create this
extra vector, you just need to supply an initialized boolean vector to
them.

     int igraph_full_bipartite(igraph_t *graph,

     			  igraph_integer_t n1, igraph_integer_t n2,
     			  igraph_bool_t directed,
     			  igraph_neimode_t mode);

   A bipartite network contains two kinds of vertices and connections
are only possible between two vertices of different kind. There are
many natural examples, e.g. movies and actors as vertices and a movie
is connected to all participating actors, etc.

   igraph does not have direct support for bipartite networks, at least
not at the C language level. In other words the igraph_t structure does
not contain information about the vertex types.  The C functions for
bipartite networks usually have an additional input argument to graph,
called `types', a boolean vector giving the vertex types.

   Most functions creating bipartite networks are able to create this
extra vector, you just need to supply an initialized boolean vector to
them.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     Pointer to an igraph_t object, the graph will be created here.

`types':
     Pointer to a boolean vector. If not a null pointer, then the
     vertex types will be stored here.

`n1':
     Integer, the number of vertices of the first kind.

`n2':
     Integer, the number of vertices of the second kind.

`directed':
     Boolean, whether to create a directed graph.

`mode':
     A constant that gives the type of connections for directed graphs.
     If `IGRAPH_OUT', then edges point from vertices of the first kind
     to vertices of the second kind; if `IGRAPH_IN', then the opposite
     direction is realized; if `IGRAPH_ALL', then mutual edges will be
     created.

     		     igraph_bool_t directed,
     		     igraph_neimode_t mode, igraph_bool_t multiple);

   A bipartite (or two-mode) graph contains two types of vertices and
edges always connect vertices of different types. An incidence matrix
is an nxm matrix, n and m are the number of vertices of the two types,
respectively. Nonzero elements in the matrix denote edges between the
two corresponding vertices.

   Note that this function can operate in two modes, depending on the
`multiple' argument. If it is FALSE (i.e. 0), then a single edge is
created for every non-zero element in the incidence matrix. If
`multiple' is TRUE (i.e. 1), then the matrix elements are rounded up to
the closest non-negative integer to get the number of edges to create
between a pair of vertices.

   This function does not create multiple edges if `multiple' is FALSE,
but might create some if it is TRUE.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     Pointer to an uninitialized graph object.

`types':
     Pointer to an initialized boolean vector, or a null pointer. If
     not a null pointer, then the vertex types are stored here. It is
     resized as needed.

`incidence':
     The incidence matrix.

`directed':
     Gives whether to create an undirected or a directed graph.

`mode':
     Specifies the direction of the edges in a directed graph. If
     `IGRAPH_OUT', then edges point from vertices of the first kind
     (corresponding to rows) to vertices of the second kind
     (corresponding to columns); if `IGRAPH_IN', then the opposite
     direction is realized; if `IGRAPH_ALL', then mutual edges will be
     created.

     int igraph_is_bipartite(const igraph_t *graph,
     			igraph_bool_t *res,
     			igraph_vector_bool_t *type);

   This function simply checks whether a graph \emph{could} be
bipartite. It tries to find a mapping that gives a possible division of
the vertices into two classes, such that no two vertices of the same
class are connected by an edge.

   The existence of such a mapping is equivalent of having no circuits
of odd length in the graph. A graph with loop edges cannot bipartite.

   Note that the mapping is not necessarily unique, e.g. if the graph
has at least two components, then the vertices in the separate
components can be mapped independently.

   *Arguments:. *

`graph':
     The input graph.

`res':
     Pointer to a boolean, the result is stored here.

`type':
     Pointer to an initialized boolean vector, or a null pointer. If
     not a null pointer and a mapping was found, then it is stored
     here. If not a null pointer, but no mapping was found, the
     contents of this vector is invalid.

   *Returns:. *

`'
     Error code.

   Time complexity: O(|V|+|E|), linear in the number of vertices and
edges.

22.1.1 Preamble
---------------

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software-to
make sure the software is free for all its users.  This General Public
License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
to any other program whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other
Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
Public License instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

22.1.2 GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
---------------------------------

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
(independent of having been made by running the Program).  Whether that
is true depends on what the Program does.

   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  1. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

  2. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
     parties under the terms of this License.

  3. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
     run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive
     use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement
     including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there
     is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and
     that users may redistribute the program under these conditions,
     and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
     (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
     normally print such an announcement, your work based on the
     Program is not required to print an announcement.)

   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a
volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other
work under the scope of this License.

   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

  1. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
     interchange; or,

  2. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
     to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of
     physically performing source distribution, a complete
     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
     customarily used for software interchange; or,

  3. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
     distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
     received the program in object code or executable form with such
     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a special
exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that
is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the
major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system
on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

   If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access
to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of
the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy
the source along with the object code.

   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise
to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
remain in full compliance.

   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
Program or works based on it.

   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the
limitation as if written in the body of this License.

   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it
and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a
version number of this License, you may choose any version ever
published by the Free Software Foundation.

   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the
Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the
two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

   NO WARRANTY

   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS
WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

22.1.3 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
----------------------------------------------------

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.


         <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
         Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

         This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
         it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
         the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
         (at your option) any later version.

         This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
         but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
         MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
         GNU General Public License for more details.

         You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
         along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
         Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:


         Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
         Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
         This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
         under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items-whatever suits your
program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:


       Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
       `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

       <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
       Ty Coon, President of Vice

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.

22.2.1 0. PREAMBLE
------------------

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with
or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

   This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
designed for free software.

   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


File: igraph_reference_manual.info,  Node: 1_ APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS,  Next: 2_ VERBATIM COPYING,  Prev: 0_ PREAMBLE,  Up: The GNU Free Documentation License

22.2.2 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
---------------------------------------

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below, refers
to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee,
and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you copy, modify
or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright
law.

   A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

   A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

   The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

   The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may be
at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

   A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly
with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic
paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor,
and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format
is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy
that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.

   The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

   A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

   The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
which states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
meaning of this License.

22.2.3 2. VERBATIM COPYING
--------------------------

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


File: igraph_reference_manual.info,  Node: 3_ COPYING IN QUANTITY,  Next: 4_ MODIFICATIONS,  Prev: 2_ VERBATIM COPYING,  Up: The GNU Free Documentation License

22.2.4 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
-----------------------------

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you
as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present the
full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible.
You may add other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with
changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of
the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
copying in other respects.

   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using public
has access to download using public-standard network protocols a
complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.  If
you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when
you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.


File: igraph_reference_manual.info,  Node: 4_ MODIFICATIONS,  Next: 5_ COMBINING DOCUMENTS,  Prev: 3_ COPYING IN QUANTITY,  Up: The GNU Free Documentation License

22.2.5 4. MODIFICATIONS
-----------------------

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of
it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

  1. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
     from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
     (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
     of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
     if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

  2. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
     responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
     Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of
     the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than
     five), unless they release you from this requirement.

  3. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
     Version, as the publisher.

  4. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

  5. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
     adjacent to the other copyright notices.

  6. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
     giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
     terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

  7. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
     Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license
     notice.

  8. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

  9. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and
     add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors,
     and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.
     If there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create
     one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the
     Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing
     the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.

 10. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
     public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
     the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
     it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
     You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
     least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
     publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

 11. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
     Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
     the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
     and/or dedications given therein.

 12. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in
     their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the equivalent
     are not considered part of the section titles.

 13. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section may
     not be included in the Modified Version.

 14. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
     or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

 15. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

   You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties-for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and
a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through
arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already includes
a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by
arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you
may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

22.2.6 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
-----------------------------

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant
Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

   In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements".

22.2.7 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
----------------------------------

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document.

22.2.8 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
--------------------------------------------

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of
the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.  When
the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply
to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative
works of the Document.

   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

22.2.9 8. TRANSLATION
---------------------

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.  Replacing
Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from
their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or
all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these
Invariant Sections.  You may include a translation of this License, and
all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers,
provided that you also include the original English version of this
License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In
case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version
of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
prevail.

   If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.

22.2.10 9. TERMINATION
----------------------

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
remain in full compliance.

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.  See

   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:


         Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
         Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
